<b>PhD thesis successfully defended</b><br />
<br />
I have finally defended my PhD thesis. A raw, unedited recording of the defense
is available on YouTube<br />

You can check out my slide deck that I used on
<a href="http://tomayac.com/phd/">http://tomayac.com/phd</a> and the PDF of the
thesis itself is available at
<a href="http://tomayac.com/phd/thesis.pdf">http://tomayac.com/phd/thesis.pdf</a
>. The source code of the thesis is available in the GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/tomayac/phd">https://github.com/tomayac/phd</a>. I
guess this makes me officially <i>Dr. Thomas Steiner</i> from now on.<br />

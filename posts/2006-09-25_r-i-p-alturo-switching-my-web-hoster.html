<br />
With the re-structuring of <a href="http://www.united-internet.de/">United Internet</a>, my former web hoster <a href="http://alturo.de">Alturo</a> has been shut down. According to the company, the market has changed enormously, and prices have gone down. Thus, the brand could no longer be maintained in a profit-making way.<br />
<br />
Alturo offers its former customers the possibility to move to <a href="http://1und1.de">1&1</a>, another sub-company of United Internet. After a quick evaluation of the present web hosting market, I found other companies offering the same features (MySQL database, PHP, SSH, FTP upload, CGIs) either for a bit less, or a lot more than I was paying before.  Basically, there are <b>many discounters offering very attractive and cheap hosting packages</b>, and there are <b>established and well-known companies offering not very attractive and quite limited packages for a lot of money</b>.<br />
<br />
Finally, I decided to accept the Alturo offer (<a href="http://www.1und1.info/xml/order/HostingHome">1&1 Home</a>), now paying almost double the price I paid before, and getting almost the same list of features, however, only 1/3 of the web space I had before. Anyway, maybe I am getting wise, old and conservative, but I need to confess that quality has its price, and I am now willing to pay it. Hopefully I will not need to switch my hosting provider again, and hopefully you have read the 'me-getting-wise' part, Dad...

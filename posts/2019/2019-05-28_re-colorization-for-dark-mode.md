A couple of weeks ago, I have collected feedback regarding people‚Äôs preferences
when it comes to re-colorization of websites for dark mode. The core research
question was: _‚ÄúDo people expect images to look different in dark mode than in
light mode?‚Äù_

#### Survey and¬†Results

I created a little
[Dark Mode Colors üåò Re-Colorization Playground app](https://dark-mode-colors.glitch.me/)
that allows people to toy around with different re-colorization options and
report their preferences in a survey. The playground app was shared
[on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev/status/1123886638965383168) and
also on multiple Google-internal _misc_ mailing lists with both technical and
non-technical audiences.

I‚Äôm now happy to briefly report on the results. All in all, I have collected 137
responses, the
[raw results are available in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OuvO64dGdGxRFDre5DOLozySfovDH1UXVcB46oZkeaQ/edit?usp=sharing).
The majority of people (57.7%) preferred a grayscale filter, 40.9% of people
preferred no filter (that is, leaving the colors _as-is_), and a tiny fraction
of people (1.5%) preferred a combination of grayscale and inversion filters. No
one liked inversion in isolation, which is in accordance with findings from
Szpiro _et al._ in their paper
[How People with Low Vision Access Computing Devices: Understanding Challenges and Opportunities](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2982168).

Digging down on the 79 responses (the 57.7%) of people who preferred a grayscale
filter, the majority opted for a value of 50%, with another small peak at 70%.

In practice, this is what _No Filter_ looks like:

Compared to _Only Grayscale: 50%_:

The advantage of a grayscale filter is that the core color information of images
is preserved, but some of the brilliance and vibrancy (that can be disturbing in
[contexts where people would typically use dark mode](https://medium.com/dev-channel/let-there-be-darkness-maybe-9facd9c3023d))
is reduced.

#### Re-Colorization in¬†Practice

How can you put these findings in practice? One way is to make the amount of
grayscaling flexible by leveraging
[CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties):

```
/* Somewhere in your CSS */

--grayscale-percentage: 50%;

img {
  filter: grayscale(var(--grayscale-percentage));
}
```

You can dynamically control the CSS variable via JavaScript:

```
/* Somewhere in your JavaScript */

const value = '70%';
document.documentElement.style.setProperty(
    '--grayscale-percentage', value);
```

#### Conclusion

As a closing thought, when you implement dark mode for a site, always keep in
mind your users. Not everyone may like your default re-colorization choices
(which can well be to have no re-colorization). Luckily, modern CSS makes it
possible to make this an _easy-to-expose_ preference. Now let there be darkness!

Both
[Facebook's Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana&hl=en)
as well as
[Facebook's iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facebook/id284882215) use a
so-called in-app browser, sometimes also referred to as IAB. The core argument
for using an in-app browser (instead of the user's default browser) is to keep
users in the app and to enable closer app integration patterns (like "quote from
a page in a new Facebook post"), while making others harder or even impossible
(like "share this link to Twitter"). Technically, IABs are implemented as
[`WebView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView)s on
Android, respectively as
[`WKWebView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview)s on
iOS. To simplify things, from hereon, I will refer to both simply as _WebViews_.

## In-App Browsers are less capable than real browsers

Turns out, WebViews are rather limited compared to real browsers like Firefox,
Edge, Chrome, and to some extent also Safari. In the past, I have done some
[research](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub46739) on their limitations when
it comes to features that are important in the context of Progressive Web Apps.
The linked paper has all the details, but you can simply see for yourself by
opening the
[üïµÔ∏è PWA Feature Detector ](https://tomayac.github.io/pwa-feature-detector/) app
that I have developed for this research in your regular browser, and then in a
WebView like Facebook's in-app browser (you can share the
[link](https://tomayac.github.io/pwa-feature-detector/) visible to just yourself
on Facebook and then click through, or try to open my
[post](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10155133394957286&id=500037285)
in the app).

## In-App Browsers can modify webpages

On top of limited features, WebViews _can_ also be used for effectively
conducting intended
[man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack),
since the IAB developer can arbitrarily
[inject JavaScript code](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView#addJavascriptInterface(java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.String)>)
and also
[intercept network traffic](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient.html#shouldInterceptRequest(android.webkit.WebView,%20android.webkit.WebResourceRequest)>).
Most of the time, this feature is used for good. For example, an airline company
might reuse the üí∫ airplane seat selector logic on both their native app as well
as on their Web app. In their native app, they would remove things like the
header and the footer, which they then would show on the Web (this is likely the
origin of the
[CSS can kill you](https://twitter.com/old_sound/status/641649070495408128)
meme).

## If you build an IAB, don't use a WebView

For these reasons, people like
[Alex Russell](https://twitter.com/slightlylate)‚Äîwhom you should definitely
follow‚Äîhave been advocating against WebView-based IABs. Instead, you should
wherever possible use
[Chrome Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs)
on Android, or the iOS counterpart
[`SFSafariViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller).
Alex [writes](https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1167567508619948032):

> Note that responsible native apps _have_ a way of creating an "in app browser"
> that doesn't subvert user choice or break the web:
>
> https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs
>
> Any browser can implement the protocol & default browser will be used. FB can
> enable this with their next update.

## If you have to use a WebView-based IAB, mark it debuggable

Alex has been telling people for a long time that they should
[mark their WebView-based IABs debuggable](https://twitter.com/patmeenan/status/1202646663124402177).
The actual code for that is a one-liner:

```java
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {
    WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true);
}
```

## Looking into Facebook's IAB

The other day, I learned with great joy that Facebook finally have marked their
IAB debuggable üéâ. [Patrick Meenan](https://twitter.com/patmeenan)‚Äîwhom you
should likewise follow and whom you might know from the amazing
[WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org/)
project‚Äî[writes](https://twitter.com/patmeenan/status/1202646668098899970) in a
Twitter thread:

> You can now remote-debug sites in the Facebook in-app browser on Android. It
> is enabled automatically so once your device is in dev mode with USB debugging
> and a browser open just visit chrome://inspect to attach to the WebView.

> The browser (on iOS and Android) is just a WebView so it should behave mostly
> like Chrome and Safari but it adds some identifiers to the UA string which
> sometimes causes pages that UA sniff to break.

> Finally, if your analytics aren't breaking out the in-app browsers for you, I
> highly recommend you see if it is possible to enable. You might be shocked at
> how much of your traffic comes from an in-app browser (odds are it is the 3rd
> most common browser behind Chrome and Safari).

I have thus followed up on the invitation and had a closer look at their IAB by
inspecting [example.org](https://example.org/) and also a simple test page
[facebook-debug.glitch.me](https://facebook-debug.glitch.me/) that contains the
[`debugger`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger)
statement in its head. I have linked a
[debug trace](/images/example_com_profile.json) üìÑ that you can open for
yourself in the Performance tab of the Chrome DevTools.

### User-Agent String

As pre-announced by Patrick, Facebook's IAB changes the `user-agent` string. The
[default WebView `user-agent` string](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/webviews#configure_webviews_for_debugging)
looks something like
`Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 5.1.1; Nexus 5 Build/LMY48B; wv) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Chrome/43.0.2357.65 Mobile Safari/537.36`
Facebook's IAB browser currently sends this:

```js
navigator.userAgent;
// "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; Pixel 3a Build/QQ2A.191125.002; wv) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Chrome/78.0.3904.108 Mobile Safari/537.36 [FB_IAB/FB4A;FBAV/250.0.0.14.241;]"
```

Compared to the default `user-agent` string, the identifying bit is the suffix
`[FB_IAB/FB4A;FBAV/250.0.0.14.241;]`.

### Added `window` properties

Facebook's IAB adds two new properties to `window`, with the values `0` and `1`.

```js
window.TEMPORARY;
// 0
window.PERSISTENT;
// 1
```

### Added `window` object

Facebook further adds a new `window` object `FbQuoteShareJSInterface`.

```js
document.onselectionchange = function () {
  window.FbQuoteShareJSInterface.onSelectionChange(
    window.getSelection().toString(),
    window.location.href
  );
};
```

This code is used for the "share quote" feature that allows users to mark text
on a page to share.

![Facebook's in-app browser and its "share quote" feature](/images/facebook_iab.png)

### Performance monitoring and feature detection

Facebook runs some performance monitoring via the
[`Performance`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance)
interface. This is split up in two scripts, each of which they seem to run three
times. They also check if a given page is using [AMP](https://amp.dev/) by
checking for the presence of the `amp` or `‚ö°Ô∏è` attribute on `<html>`.

```js
void (function () {
  try {
    if (window.location.href === 'about:blank') {
      return;
    }
    if (
      !window.performance ||
      !window.performance.timing ||
      !document ||
      !document.body ||
      document.body.scrollHeight <= 0 ||
      !document.body.children ||
      document.body.children.length < 1
    ) {
      return;
    }
    var nvtiming__fb_t = window.performance.timing;
    if (nvtiming__fb_t.responseEnd > 0) {
      console.log('FBNavResponseEnd:' + nvtiming__fb_t.responseEnd);
    }
    if (nvtiming__fb_t.domContentLoadedEventStart > 0) {
      console.log(
        'FBNavDomContentLoaded:' + nvtiming__fb_t.domContentLoadedEventStart
      );
    }
    if (nvtiming__fb_t.loadEventEnd > 0) {
      console.log('FBNavLoadEventEnd:' + nvtiming__fb_t.loadEventEnd);
    }
    var nvtiming__fb_html = document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0];
    if (nvtiming__fb_html) {
      var nvtiming__fb_html_amp =
        nvtiming__fb_html.hasAttribute('amp') ||
        nvtiming__fb_html.hasAttribute('\u26A1');
      console.log('FBNavAmpDetect:' + nvtiming__fb_html_amp);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('fb_navigation_timing_error:' + err.message);
  }
})();
// FBNavResponseEnd:1575904580720
// FBNavDomContentLoaded:1575904586057
// FBNavAmpDetect:false
```

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
  console.info(
    'FBNavDomContentLoaded:' +
      window.performance.timing.domContentLoadedEventStart
  );
});
// FBNavDomContentLoaded:1575904586057
```

## Feature Policy tests

They run some
[Feature Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy)
tests via a function named `getFeaturePolicyAllowListOnPage()`. You can see the
documentation for the tested
[directives](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy)
on the Mozilla Developer Network.

```js
(function () {
  function getFeaturePolicyAllowListOnPage(features) {
    const map = {};
    const featurePolicy = document.policy || document.featurePolicy;
    for (const feature of features) {
      map[feature] = {
        allowed: featurePolicy.allowsFeature(feature),
        allowList: featurePolicy.getAllowlistForFeature(feature),
      };
    }
    return map;
  }
  const allPolicies = [
    'geolocation',
    'midi',
    'ch-ect',
    'execution-while-not-rendered',
    'layout-animations',
    'vertical-scroll',
    'forms',
    'oversized-images',
    'document-access',
    'magnetometer',
    'picture-in-picture',
    'modals',
    'unoptimized-lossless-images-strict',
    'accelerometer',
    'vr',
    'document-domain',
    'serial',
    'encrypted-media',
    'font-display-late-swap',
    'unsized-media',
    'ch-downlink',
    'ch-ua-arch',
    'presentation',
    'xr-spatial-tracking',
    'lazyload',
    'idle-detection',
    'popups',
    'scripts',
    'unoptimized-lossless-images',
    'sync-xhr',
    'ch-width',
    'ch-ua-model',
    'top-navigation',
    'ch-lang',
    'camera',
    'ch-viewport-width',
    'loading-frame-default-eager',
    'payment',
    'pointer-lock',
    'focus-without-user-activation',
    'downloads-without-user-activation',
    'ch-rtt',
    'fullscreen',
    'autoplay',
    'execution-while-out-of-viewport',
    'ch-dpr',
    'hid',
    'usb',
    'wake-lock',
    'ch-ua-platform',
    'ambient-light-sensor',
    'gyroscope',
    'document-write',
    'unoptimized-lossy-images',
    'sync-script',
    'ch-device-memory',
    'orientation-lock',
    'ch-ua',
    'microphone',
  ];
  return getFeaturePolicyAllowListOnPage(allPolicies);
})();
```

Not all directives are currently supported by the WebView, so a number of
warnings are logged. The recognized ones (i.e., the output of the
`getFeaturePolicyAllowListOnPage()` function above) result in an object as
follows.

## HTTP headers

I checked the response and request headers, but nothing special stood out. The
only remarkable thing given that they look at Feature Policy is the _absence_ of
the
[`Feature-Policy` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy).

## Conclusion

All in all, these are all the things Facebook did that I could observe on the
pages that I have tested. I didn't notice any click listeners or scroll
listeners (that could be used for engagement tracking of Facebook users with the
pages they browse on) or any other kind of "phoning home" functionality, but
they _could_ of course have implemented this natively via the WebView's
[`View.OnScrollChangeListener`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.OnScrollChangeListener)
or
[`View.OnClickListener`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.OnClickListener),
as they
[did](https://github.com/reverseengineeringer/com.facebook.orca/blob/fac06904e19e204c9561438e4890e76c6ee00830/src/com/facebook/browser/lite/aq.java#L13)
for long clicks for the [`FbQuoteShareJSInterface`](#added-window-object).

That being said, if after reading this you prefer your links to open in your
default browser, it's well hidden, but definitely possible:
`Settings > Media and Contacts > Links open externally`.

It goes without saying, but just in case: _all code snippets in this post are
owned by and copyright of Facebook_.

Did you run a similar analysis with similar (or maybe different) findings? Let
me know on Twitter or Mastodon by posting your thoughts with a

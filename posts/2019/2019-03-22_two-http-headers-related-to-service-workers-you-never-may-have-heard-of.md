## The second one will make you talk to your webmaster…

The other day, one of my former Google Mobile Solutions Consultant colleagues
sent an email to an internal mailing list that (paraphrased) went like this:

> “I was shocked that during now more than two years of supporting Service
> Worker implementations, I only found out about the `service-worker-allowed`
> header today.” 😳

I suspect at least some of you are the same, so let me explain not just this,
but also a second interesting HTTP header related to Service Workers that are
both probably _not_ the ones you read about when you follow any of the many
Service Worker tutorials out there.

#### **Header** № 1: \`**service-worker-allowed\`**

This is one of the a little more obscure Service Worker features, but it’s very
useful. You can see it in action on Google Docs, where the URL you’re on with
[multi-account login](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1721977?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
is something like `https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/` (the final number
determines the active account), but where the actual Service Worker JavaScript
file comes from
`https://docs.google.com/document/offline/serviceworker.js?ouid=ude32cf1e51077bff&zx=hyah3kexco7d`
(your query parameters may differ).

Now why does this matter? Let’s briefly recall the
[concept of a Service Worker’s](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-service-worker#registration_and_scope)
`[scope](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-service-worker#registration_and_scope)`:
The `scope` of the Service Worker determines which files the Service Worker
controls, in other words, from which path the Service Worker will intercept
requests. The default `scope` is the location of the Service Worker file, and
extends to all directories below. So if `serviceworker.js` is located in the
root directory, the Service Worker will control requests from all files at this
domain.

Now you may notice that in the case of Google Docs, the default `scope` would be
`https://docs.google.com/document/offline/`, which is not enough, as the user is
working in `https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/`. This is where finally the
`service-worker-allowed` header comes in. It allows Google Docs to ask for a
wider `scope` of `https://docs.google.com/document/` instead 🎉. This header is
[supported by all browsers](https://wpt.fyi/results/service-workers/service-worker/Service-Worker-Allowed-header.https.html?label=master&product=chrome%5Bexperimental%5D&product=edge&product=firefox%5Bexperimental%5D&product=safari%5Bexperimental%5D&aligned&q=service-worker-allowed)
and if you’re interested in all the details, this is the
[deep link to the header’s section in the spec](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#service-worker-allowed).
You can see it in action in the screenshot below.

#### Header № 2: \`**service-worker\`**

As we’re at it, another header you might not have heard of is `service-worker`.
It indicates when a request is for a Service Worker’s script resource and helps
administrators and webmasters log such requests and detect threats (so talk to
them, they’ll probably appreciate it;
[Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)’s
[article](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/launching-sw-without-breaking-the-web/#pros)
has all the details). This header as well is
[supported by all browsers](https://wpt.fyi/results/service-workers/service-worker/service-worker-header.https.html?label=master&product=chrome%5Bexperimental%5D&product=edge&product=firefox%5Bexperimental%5D&product=safari%5Bexperimental%5D&aligned&q=service-worker),
and here is the
[deep link to its section in the spec](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#service-worker-script-request).
You can see it in action when you go to Facebook. Facebook’s Service Worker
comes from
`[https://www.facebook.com/sw?s=push](https://www.facebook.com/sw?s=push)`, but
if you try to open this URL, you’ll not see the JavaScript code, but a Facebook
error page. You actually _need_ to send the header in order for Facebook to
return the code.

This initially caught me when I developed the
[👷‍♀️ 👷 Service Worker Detector browser extension](https://github.com/google/service-worker-detector#--installation),
but after reading the spec, I was then
[sending the correct header](https://github.com/google/service-worker-detector/blob/f257aa9a77951f8ec972bf271093c75e86f73e55/contentscript.js#L71-L75)
in the extension’s content script, so that it now works as expected.

If you encounter this header being required by the server, for quick debugging
sessions in the browser or from the terminal, a cool Chrome DevTools tip is to
right-click the Service Worker request and then “Copy as cURL” or “Copy as
fetch”. 👌

Did _you_ know about these headers? Let me know in the comments or ping me,

still have your attention, the Mobile Solutions Consultant team (my former team)
are

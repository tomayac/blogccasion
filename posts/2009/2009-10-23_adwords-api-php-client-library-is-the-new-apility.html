<b>AdWords API PHP Client Library is the new APIlity</b><br />
<br />
<u>Dear APIlity users,</u><br />
<br />
It has been a long time since my last message to the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/adwords-api-php">APIlity forum</a>.
Actually, the last message dates back to May 8, 2009. Since then a lot has
happened. The last public APIlity release was
<a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/google-apility/files/APIlity/1.13.1/apility_1.13.1.zip/download"
  >v1.13.1</a
>. In June I was in New York City,
<a href="http://twitter.com/tomayac/status/2401451986">working on</a>
<a href="http://twitter.com/tomayac/status/2128395541">getting APIlity ready</a>
for the AdWords API v2009 release. Back then, v200902 was released, while
internally we were working with v200906, which was in the early stage of
development.<br />
<br />
If you are in the <b>PHP framework business</b>, or worse, in the
<b>PHP framework business and dealing with SOAP Web services</b>, you have
probably gone through the same trouble as we did with APIlity: there is (mainly
PHP4's) <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nusoap/">NuSOAP</a>, there is
PHP5's native
<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.soap.php">SOAP extension</a>, and there
is the strong feeling that you should definitely get off that PHP4 train, but
some important stakeholder is still on it. Basically the AdWords API v2009 beta
release being a <b>complete rewrite of the AdWords API from scratch</b> with
awesome
<a href="https://code.google.com/apis/adwords/v2009/docs/releasenotes.html"
  >new features</a
>, we decided to do the same for APIlity. This is actually good news:
<b>no more PHP4</b>, <b>no more NuSOAP</b>, but a lot
<b>more object-orientation</b>, and definitely <b>more feature parity</b> with
the other client libraries. We are thus starting the
<a
  href="http://adwordsapi.blogspot.com/2009/10/were-happy-to-announce-newest-version.html"
  >deprecation clock</a
>
for APIlity in its current form (i.e. v1.13.1). Because of the hard cut and the
underlying SOAP toolkit change (NuSOAP replaced by native SOAP extension), the
first release of the <b style="color: darkgreen">new PHP client library</b> (<a
  href="https://code.google.com/p/google-api-adwords-php/"
  >https://code.google.com/p/google-api-adwords-php</a
>) just ships with the true <b>v2009 core features</b>, and does not include the
old v13 features as the other client libraries do. What this means in practice
is that you should use the PHP client library for your AdWords core tasks, and
use APIlity v1.13.1 for the tasks not yet included in v2009. There will not be
added new features to APIlity, but we will still provide bug fixes. In the end
when v13 of the AdWords API itself will be sunset, APIlity v13 will follow.<br />

/>While the name <b>APIlity</b> is a great wordplay (at least in my opinion) on
<b>API</b> and the abi<b>lity</b> to do things with the AdWords API, it never
was a great name from a readability point of view, basically because most
default Web fonts
<a href="https://images.google.com/images?q=i+shot+the+serif">shot the serif</a
>, so the uppercase <b>'I'</b> of the "API" part and the lowercase <b>'l'</b> of
the "lity" part were hard to differentiate. In consequence for the rewritten
library we simply go for the generic name <b>PHP client library</b>, just as
there is the Java client library, or the Python client library. You got the
naming schemeâ€¦<br />
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
<br />
In addition to that, the former
<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/adwords-api-php">APIlity forum</a> will
be deprecated somewhere around November 1 and set to Archive Mode, where old
messages will be preserved, but new messages will be rejected and should instead
be posted to the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/adwords-api">main AdWords API forum</a
>. This will improve overall turnaround time for getting your questions answered
and will give you access to even more AdWords API developers.<br />
<br />
Finally I would like to <b>express my gratitude</b> to all those of you who have
contributed to the library in the past. Be it by sending in <b>bug reports</b>,
<b>bug fixes</b>, or even <b>completely new functions</b>. I have maintained a
naive and very direct form of the
<a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/ar01s16.html"
  >benevolent dictator</a
>
maintenance model, where people would contact me directly (<a
  href="mailto:tomacATgoogleDOTcom"
  >mailto:tomac AT google DOT com</a
>) and I would then decide whether or not to include a patch, or decide for one
alternative or the other if more than one were given. The new PHP client library
will be hosted on <a href="https://code.google.com/">code.google.com</a>, where
excellent issue tracking, an uncomplicated release mechanism, and version
control are available, so these features will be used.
<b>Hoping for you contributors to keep up your excellent support</b> even if
ownership of the library has changed. Last not least
<b>I will be the heaviest Google-internal user</b> of the PHP client library, so
be assured that I will be somewhere buzzing around still, and, yes, of course I
am a
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-api-adwords-php/people/list"
  >committer to the project</a
>.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Tom<br />

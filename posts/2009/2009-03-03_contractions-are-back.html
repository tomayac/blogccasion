<b>Contractions are back</b><br />
<br />
It has been an unquiet night so far. Doctors come in with the antibiotics whenever Laura catches a little sleep, and if it's not the docs coming in, it's the neighbors running out. Hospitals are by far the least relaxing locations I can think of. There are 10 (read binary) types of people here: those who have already delivered, and those who are yet to have the baby. While the first group wanders around trying to make the new-born sleep, the second group wanders around trying to make the baby come out. Actually, the second group is sub-divided in happy couples like Laura and me, where the husband cares and tries to assist, and the other sub-group of the poor lonely women. They hang around in the corridor heavily breathing into their cell phones because their partners cannot make it to the hospital for whatever reasons. <i>This</i> must be real horror. Glad I can support Laura a bit better than that. She is off for another examination right now where I am not permitted. It's in these examination breaks where I write all these posts, just in case someone was wondering. Each exam takes like 45 minutes, an eternity if you are waiting for <i>your</i> baby to be born. Thank God contractions have started again nowâ€¦

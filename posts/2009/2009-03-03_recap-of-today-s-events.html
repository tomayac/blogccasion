<b>Recap of today's events</b><br />
<br />
Well, the title is more promising than the actual things that happened during
the day. Laura has changed rooms, she's in a single room now including a TV set
with VHS video (the elders might remember this tape-based DVD format). This is
probably the only good thing about being treated like an outlaw in a hospital.
Evil Norovirus, evil you! Oh, and Laura gets her antibiotics in form of pills
now. The other big change of the day. Are you just as moved as we are? I have
passed three hours at home with Lena and Laura's family, and now I am back with
Laura and Emma(!). 18:30. Two slices of bread? Check. One slice of cheese?
Check. Contractions? Duh. While Laura is forced to eat the hospital food, I
decided to have a Döner Kebab at a food stand close to the hospital. I deeply
regret now. Remember? I am to wear mouth protection…

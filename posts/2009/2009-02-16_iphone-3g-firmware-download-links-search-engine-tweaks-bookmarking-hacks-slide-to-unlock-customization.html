  "slide to unlock" Customization</b

There is a few things I usually do when Apple decides to release a firmware
update for the one and only

    <b>Jailbreak the device:</b> to me my iPhone is not so much a phone, but a
    computer in my pocket that happens to be able to do phone calls as well. It
    has a <i>terminal</i>, it has <i>Internet access</i>, and it can run
    <i>vi</i>. I have been all the way through jailbreaking, starting with
    <a href="http://jailbreakme.com/">jailbreakme.com</a> with manually SSH'ing
    into the device and installing stuff, over to
    <a href="http://www.ziphone.org/">ziPhone</a>, and for quite some time now
    the awesome <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/">Dev-Team's PwnageTool</a>.
    One annoying task each time is finding the direct download links for the
    firmware IPSW files. The iPhone checks
    <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/version">http://phobos.apple.com/version</a
    >, which is an ugly machine-readable XML file, but there is also a
    human-readable version of the
    <a href="http://www.trejan.com/projects/ipod/phobos.html"
      >iTunes Firmware Update Table</a
    >
    available over at trejan.com's.
  </li>

    My regional settings are German. in consequence the iPhone thinks that I
    want to use Google in German. While this is true in about 30% of the cases,
    the major annoyance is that the default
    <b
      >search interface accessible from the search bar is not
      mobile-optimized</b
    >. On mobile devices the default Google search experience should be
    <a href="https://www.google.com/m/">https://www.google.com/m/</a>, or the
    local TLD version respectively, e.g.
    <a href="http://www.google.de/m/">http://www.google.de/m/</a>. You can force
    your iPhone to use Google in your preferred domain in the mobile-optimized
    interface as follows (Jailbreak required):
    <ul>
      <li>SSH into your device.</li>
      <li>
        Navigate to
        <span style="font-family: monospace"
          >/Applications/MobileSafari.app</span
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Locate the file
        <span style="font-family: monospace">GoogleTLDs.plist</span> and
        download it to your computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        With some kind of Property List Editor (one ships with Apple's Developer
        Tools, you might have to convert the file from binary to textual) find
        the entry for the Google TLD that your iPhone uses by default (in my
        case it is <i>.de</i>, so the key is
        <span style="font-family: monospace"><key>DE</key></span
        >).
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the string of the value (not the key itself) to the TLD of your
        choice (in order to make it <i>.com/m</i> I went for
        <span style="font-family: monospace"><string>com/m</string></span
        >).
      </li>
      <li>
        Copy the modified file back to your iPhone (paranoids make a backup of
        the file, all others regret later).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Mobile Safari misses the feature to open links in a new tab</b>. This is
    particularly useful if you read the news, Digg, or any other "many
    interesting stories on one page" kind of site. While there is a bookmarklet
    called
    <a href="http://gadgets.inventivelabs.com.au/tabulate">Tabulate</a> that
    does exactly the job, getting it installed is a pain if you do not want to
    lose your bookmarks from Mobile Safari, or if you do not use (desktop)
    Safari bookmark synchronization. But there is hope. As outlined before
    obtain the bookmark's plist file at
    <span style="font-family: monospace"
      >/var/mobile/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist</span
    >
    and at the appropriate section (you will get it if you just work through the
    node list) add the bookmarklet's URIDictionary. It should look somehow like
    this:<br />
    <div style="text-align: center">
      <img
        src="/images/MobileSafari_Bookmarks.plist.png"
        alt="MobileSafari Bookmarks.plist"
        width="570"
        height="378"
      />
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    At developer events you rarely are the only one to own an iPhone, so having
    a quick option to check whether a specific phone is yours might be helpful.
    I decided to <b>brand my "slide to unlock" field with my name</b> just to be
    on the safe side. This is as easy as SSH'ing into
    <span style="font-family: monospace"
      >/System/Library/CoreServices/SpringBoard.app/English.lproj</span
    >, and changing the key
    <span style="font-family: monospace">AWAY_LOCK_LABEL</span> to whatever you
    like (again, the value of the key, not the key itself). Respring or reboot
    both put the change in effect (respringing put my device in safe mode for
    the first time, then it worked).
  </li>
</ol>
Hope you found some of this useful. What is your iPhone setup ToDo list after a
firmware upgrade? Oh, and almost forgot: use AptBackup and read
<a href="http://thebigboss.org/guides/how-to-upgrade-in-itunes/"
  >how to backup your Cydia apps via iTunes</a
>
before you apply your next firmware update.

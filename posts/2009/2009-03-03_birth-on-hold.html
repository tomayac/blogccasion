<b>Birth on hold</b><br />
<br />
Oh man, Lena went through it, I went through it, and now finally the doctors
suspect Laura as well to go through it: an infection with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus">Norovirus</a>. They say this
might be the reason for the contraction back and forth. Laura has passed a not
so funny night with the symptoms mentioned in the linked Wikipedia article. Poor
Laura, she may not receive anymore visitors except me, and me too I have to wear
mouth and body infection protection just to see her. We do not know yet what
happens next, but seems like the birth process is on hold for the moment. Must
be a little Emma given all the trouble this baby causesâ€¦

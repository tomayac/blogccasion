<b>Sleepless in Hamburg</b><br />
<br />
It's only since Monday early morning that we are in hospital, but it already
feels like a week or so. The first day was more like "it can happen at any
time", while the second was all like "the baby will never come". We are still
Norovirus outlaws which means that by all means I am no longer permitted for a
sleep-over in Laura's room (which technically I even wasn't before). Heading
home now with the feeling that March 4 is not that bad a date neither, and
shortly before leaving the baby was moving a lot, so maybe the doctor's argument
"we all need our forces tomorrow" is true. Laura was already halfway asleep when
I left, Emma(?) and me had an intimate farewellâ€¦ Maybe by tomorrow I can say
hello to wonderful little hands rather than saying good bye to wonderful kicking
feet. We'll see, but both Laura and me believe that this night I won't have to
rush back to the hospital. Actually, yes, after more than 48 hours hardly
without any eye closed, we <i>do</i> need some sleep!

<b>Groundhog day</b><br />
<br />
Waiting at home is boring, waiting in hospital is hell. It has been a real groundhog day so far: breakfast at 7:30, two slices of bread, one of cheese. Tea. Coffee. Books. Magazines. Newspaper. 9:30. What's next? If before we thought the meant-to-be last few evenings at home were getting long, now it's even worse. Fortunately Laura can sleep a bit now, and my day has been saved so far thanks to c't and DIE ZEIT (the first is a German IT magazine, the latter a weekly biiiiig newspaper). Did anyone mention contractions or delivering a baby? We feel more like a quarantine patient and a doctor, typing these lines with latex protective glovesâ€¦ Hints for provoking contractions? Anyone?

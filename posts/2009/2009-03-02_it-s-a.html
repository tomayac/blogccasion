<b>It's a…</b><br />
<br />
The waiting has an end… Later today. We have arrived at the hospital like 1.5h ago, and after the initial examination the doctors say, the baby will definitely be born today, and have placed me in the waiting room. There I sit, waiting. Accompagnied by my iPhone at least I can share my impatience. Oh, and there is one more thing: I <i>think</i> it's a girl. Emma? March 2, that's sure for now at least <span style="font-family:monospace;">:-D</span>

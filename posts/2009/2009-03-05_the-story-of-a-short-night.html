<b>The story of a short night</b><br />
<br />
Remember the blog post from two days ago? I ended like neither Laura nor me
believe that I have to rush back to the hospital. Well, as you have read, the
story's ending (or should I say its beginning?) has been different. Let's begin
at midnight of the night March 3 to 4: I stayed with Laura until they really,
really made me go. The doctors were convinced that the baby would not come that
night, and suggested to get some sleep for the events to come. Well, as it was
quite late, I did not catch the last subway, so I had to wait some time at a
subway station to catch at least one of the night service busses. As I was
really tired I fell asleep immediately after having arrived at home by 1:30 in
the middle of the night. Exactly 2.5 hours of sleep later, Laura called telling
me that the contractions had started. Having missed the last subway, at 4:00 in
the morning obviously subway service had not been taken up again, so I had to
call a cab. 30 minutes later I arrived at the hospital where I had to leave
Laura exactly 4.5 hours before. 5 hours later we held Emma in our handsâ€¦ The
family is complete now, Lena has just arrived to visit Emma, Laura, and me. Time
to turn the iPhone off. There's more important things in life than blogging.

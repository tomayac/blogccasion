I recently was more Twitter-oriented and did not touch my blog a lot. This does
not mean at all that the blog is dead, it is just a matter of time, and the fact
that I rather spend time with my wonderful family after work than that I would
blog. This is one of the few times where I replicate my Twitter stuff on my
blog, simply because I want as many persons as possible to see this excellent
presentation from the Google Webmasters Team:<br />

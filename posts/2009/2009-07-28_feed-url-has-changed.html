<b>Feed URL has changed</b><br />
<br />
<img

  alt="ATOM 1.0"
  width="16"
  height="16"
/>My <a href="/atom.php">ATOM feed URL</a> has changed. It is way shorter now,
the dynamic parameters have been removed, and now I use the feed as a Sitemap as
well. Using
<a
  href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=34654#1"
  >RSS or ATOM feeds as Sitemap</a
>
is a not so well known chapter of the Sitemap story. I will leave the old URL
active for a while, but you are highly recommended to update your feed reader to
include the new URL
<span style="font-family: monospace">https://blog.tomayac.com/atom.php</span>.
Thanks, and sorry for the inconvenience.<br />

At some point I want to restructure the whole blog as well, starting with the
feed URL is a first step. Looking forward to the next one. Sometime. I was a
little naive back in 2005 when I wrote one of my first blog entries, but
<a
  href="/index.php?date=2005-10-23&time=01:06:29&perma=Why+I+started+to+blo.html"
  >my thoughts from then</a
>
on blog content ownership are still true. Hey, and it's totally fun writing your
own blog engine, too.

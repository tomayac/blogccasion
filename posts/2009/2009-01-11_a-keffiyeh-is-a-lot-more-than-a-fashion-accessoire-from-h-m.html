>Back in November 2008 I was a
<a

  >speaker at the Google Developer Day in Tel Aviv</a

  >presentation on Google Web Toolkit</a

in Hebrew you say "hello" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom"

  >keffiyeh</a
>, be aware that it is a lot more than a fashion accessoire from H&M. Make an
effort with me an recall this fact to the 12-year-olds when you see them with
their scarfs. Shalom. As-Salamu Alaykum.<br />

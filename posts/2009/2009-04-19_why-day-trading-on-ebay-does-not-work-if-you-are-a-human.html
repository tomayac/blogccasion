<b>Why day-trading on eBay does not work if you are a human</b><br />
<br />
It all started with the official
<a href="http://pages.ebay.com/mobile/iphone.html">eBay iPhone app</a>: suddenly
you could browse eBay for bargains wherever you were and whenever. 4 am and
awake in bed? Why not browse eBay for soon-ending deals? I did a few tests in
some sleepless nights. iPhones seemed like the perfect victims: there are many
on sale, and they are still traded at high value even if they are used, like
most Apple products. I spidered for <i>iphone</i>, <i>ipohne</i>, <i>iphnoe</i>,
and <i>iphoen</i>, with the idea in mind of covering the product itself and the
most common, but not so evident typos. Even at night times (or maybe especially
there) you are competing with some kind of eBay last minute bidding bots. The
deal seems great, you wait with you thumb on your iPhone eBay app's "confirm
bid" button, silently count <i>3, 2, 1, and bid</i>, just to be outbid by a
machine. While this is definitely nothing new to anyone with a certain eBay
experience, it still just doesn't seem fair, and totally ruins the fun of eBay.
This are my findings:<br />

I did not include the last row with the balance because it hurts too much if you
keep in mind that there is eBay's sales split missing, which is currently
<b>EUR 4,00 plus 5,0% of the auction price over EUR 50,00</b> for private
auctions ranging from EUR 50,01 to EUR 500,00. Thus in the first case of the
iPhone 3G this is EUR 352 * 0,05 + EUR 4,00 = EUR 21,60. So in order to make any
profit from buying and reselling at eBay you'd have to make quite some good
deals at buying time, or find some really desperate buyer at selling time. It
did not work out for my tests. Maybe I am just too naive or stupid, but for me
<b>eBay as a selling platform is dead</b>. At least if you are a human, and not
a last minute bidding bot.

<b>On Parental Leave...</b><br />
<br />
Some of you might have noticed that my last blog entry already dates back some time, and the <a href="/ViewByCategories.php?category=Work">Work</a> category - usually the busiest one - is quite calm recently. This is for one great reason: I am on parental leave, and probably having the best time of my life. Just Laura and me, waiting for the baby (due date is September 16th), doing things the easy way, taking more time for everything, and first of all, <b>taking the time for really getting prepared to be parents</b>. We made a huge flying wooden dragon from plywood the last few days, where one day was planning, one day sawing, one day balancing and painting, and one day vanishing and mounting it. If someone is interested, I would be happy to share instructions or detailed photos. I also did a little video editing and posted the result to YouTube. And man, this dragon <i>is</i> huge...<br />

I will take up work again as a Customer Solutions Engineer with Google Inc. on October 1st, working remotely from Barcelona for the first time until the baby is out of the woods <small>(German: <i>aus dem Gr?bsten heraus sein</i>)</small>, and then later from Hamburg, Germany.<br />

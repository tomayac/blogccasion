Google, like many other companies, has a required working from home (WFH) policy
during the COVID-19 crisis.
It has taken me a bit, but now I have found a decent WFH setup.

## The Hardware

- A [MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air#Third_generation_(Retina_and_USB-C)):
  This is simply the corporate machine I had before.
  Its keyboard is still working fine, but for ergonomic reasons, I have an external wired
  [Apple A1243 keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Keyboard#/media/File:Apple_Keyboard_with_Numeric_Keyboard_9612.jpg)
  and a wired [Apple Mighty Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Mighty_Mouse)
  connected to it. Update: I have now replaced the mouse with a [Magic Trackpad 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Trackpad_2).
- An [iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (2nd generation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro#Second_generation):
  This is a dented, scratched device from 2017 that I bought for €349.99
  (incl. tax, customs, and shipping) from a [dealer](https://www.ebay.de/usr/pre-tech?ul_noapp=true)
  in the UK
  [on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=iPad%20Pro%20%2812.9-inch%29%20%282nd%20generation%29&_sacat=0&LH_BIN=1&rt=nc&_udlo=300&_udhi=400)
  (this is the search deeplink that I used).
- An [iPad Air&nbsp;2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Air_2): This is a private device from 2014.
- A [Lenovo Smart Clock](https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/introducing-lenovo-smart-clock-with-google-assistant/):
  This mostly just serves as a photo frame, and of course as a desk clock.

## The Software

- The [Sidecar](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210380) feature, so I can use my iPad Pro
  as a second screen with my MacBook Air.
  The coolest about this feature is that I can multitask it away (see next bullet)
  without the laptop readjusting the screen arrangement.
- The [Hangouts Meet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hangouts-meet-by-google/id1013231476) app
  on my iPad Pro, so my laptop performance stays unaffected when I am on a video call.
  A nice side-effect is that the camera of the iPad Pro is in the middle of my two screens,
  so no weird "looking over the other person" effect when I am on a call.
- The [Gmail](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480) app
  on my iPad Air, so I can always have an eye on my email.
- (Honorable mention) The [iDisplay](http://getidisplay.com/) app on the iPad Air
  with the iDisplay server running on the laptop, so I can use the iPad Air as a third screen.
  Unfortunately, since I do not have another free USB&nbsp;C port on my laptop,
  it is really laggy over Wi-Fi, but works when I really need maximum screen real estate.
- (Out of scope) The [Free Sidecar](https://github.com/ben-z/free-sidecar) project promises to
  enable Sidecar on older iPads like my iPad Air&nbsp;2,
  since apparently Apple simply blocks older devices for no particular reason.
  It requires temporarily turning off System Integrity Protection,
  which is something I cannot (and do not want to) do on my corporate laptop.

## The Furniture

- A [school desk](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aschau_im_Chiemgau,_Lausbuambankerl,_1.jpeg)—This
  is a desk we had bought earlier on eBay, placed on two kids' chairs to convert it into a standing desk.
- Some shoe boxes to elevate the two main screens to eye height.
  I had quite some neck pain during the first couple of days.

It is definitely not perfect, but I am quite happy with it now.
I very much want the crisis to be over, but (with the kids back in school),
I could probably get used to permanently working from home.

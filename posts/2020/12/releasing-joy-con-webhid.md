The [WebHID API](https://web.dev/hid/) received its
[third LGTM](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/rL1csFYD1Ms/m/d7y9_OftAQAJ)
on December 17, which means it is approved for shipping in Chrome&nbsp;ðŸŽ‰.
WebHID allows websites to access devices that use the human interface devices
([HID](https://www.usb.org/hid)) protocol via JavaScript. Here is a little
Christmas present&nbsp;ðŸŽ„ to the community to celebrate the API approval:
releasing [Joy-Con WebHID](https://github.com/tomayac/joy-con-webhid), a WebHID
"driver" for
[Nintendo Joy-Con controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy-Con) so you can
use them in the browser. If you have Joy-Cons, be sure to check out the
[demo](https://tomayac.github.io/joy-con-webhid/demo/) to get a feel for what is
possible.

## Using the library

Getting started is straight-forward. Make sure you have a pairing button on your
page.

```html
<button class="connect" type="button">Connect Joy-Con</button>
```

Import the script and hook up the pairing button. Then create an interval that
waits for Joy-Cons to appear, which can happen after pairing, on page load when
previously paired Joy-Cons are reconnected, and when Joy-Cons wake up again
after being idle.

```js
import * as JoyCon from './node_modules/dist/index.js';

// For the initial pairing of the Joy-Cons. They need to be paired one by one.
// Once paired, Joy-Cons will be reconnected to on future page loads.
document.querySelector('.connect').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  // `JoyCon.connectJoyCon()` handles the initial HID pairing.
  // It keeps track of connected Joy-Cons in the `JoyCon.connectedJoyCons` Map.
  await JoyCon.connectJoyCon();
});

// Joy-Cons may sleep until touched and fall asleep again if idle, so attach
// the listener dynamically, but only once.
setInterval(async () => {
  for (const joyCon of JoyCon.connectedJoyCons.values()) {
    if (joyCon.eventListenerAttached) {
      continue;
    }
    // Open the device and enable standard full mode and inertial measurement
    // unit mode, so the Joy-Con activates the gyroscope and accelerometers.
    await joyCon.open();
    await joyCon.enableStandardFullMode();
    await joyCon.enableIMUMode();
    // Get information about the connected Joy-Con.
    console.log(await joyCon.getDeviceInfo());
    // Listen for HID input reports.
    joyCon.addEventListener('hidinput', ({ detail }) => {
      // Careful, this fires at ~60fps.
      console.log(`Input report from ${joyCon.device.productName}:`, detail);
    });
    joyCon.eventListenerAttached = true;
  }
}, 2000);
```

Check the file
[`demo/index.js`](https://github.com/tomayac/joy-con-webhid/blob/main/demo/index.js)
to see how to deal with the various signals you receive from the driver.

## Chrome Dino WebHID

A first example that I have built based on the Joy-Con WebHID project is
[Chrome Dino WebHID](https://github.com/tomayac/chrome-dino-webhid). It allows
you to
[play the `chrome://dino` game](https://tomayac.github.io/chrome-dino-webhid/)&nbsp;ðŸ¦–
via WebHID using your Joy-Cons. Here is a video preview of what to expect:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HuhQXXgDnCQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Why not use the Gamepad API?

The [Gamepad API](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/) supports Joy-Con controllers
out-of-the-box, but since the API (currently) does not have a concept of
orientation, the Joy-Cons' accelerometer and gyroscope data cannot be accessed.
The buttons and analog sticks are fully exposed, though. If all you need is
this, then by all means [go for the Gamepad API](https://web.dev/gamepad/).

## Credits

Joy-Con WebHID takes heavy inspiration from [@wazho](https://github.com/wazho)'s
[ns-joycon](https://github.com/wazho/ns-joycon), which in turn is based on
[@dekuNukem](https://github.com/dekuNukem)'s
[Nintendo_Switch_Reverse_Engineering](https://github.com/dekuNukem/Nintendo_Switch_Reverse_Engineering).

The [PageSpeed](https://www.modpagespeed.com/) modules (not to be confused with
the
[PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
site analysis service), are open-source webserver modules that optimize your
site automatically. Namely, there is
[mod_pagespeed](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pagespeed-mod) for the
[Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) server and
[ngx_pagespeed](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pagespeed-ngx) for the
[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) server. For example, PageSpeed can automatically
create WebP versions for all your image resources, and conditionally _only_
serve the format to clients that accept `image/webp`. I use it on this very
blog, inspect a request to [any JPEG image](/images/thomas_steiner_small.jpg)
and see how on supporting browsers it gets served as WebP.

## The impact of Brotli compression

When it comes to compression, [Brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) really
makes a difference. Brotli compression is only supported over HTTPS and is
requested by clients by including `br` in the `accept-encoding` header. In
practice, Chrome sends
[`accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:net/url_request/url_request_http_job.cc;l=525-527).
As an example for the positive impact compared to gzip, check out a recent case
study shared by
[Addy Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1220085588948185088) in
which the web team of the hotel company [Treebo](https://www.treebo.com/) share
their
[Tale of Brotli Compression](https://tech.treebo.com/a-tale-of-brotli-compression-bcb071d9780a).

## PageSpeed does not support Brotli yet

While both webservers support Brotli compression out of the box, Apache via
[mod_brotli](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_brotli.html) and Nginx
via [ngx_brotli](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli), one thing that PageSpeed
is currently missing is native Brotli support, causing resources that went
through any PageSpeed optimization step to not be Brotli-encoded ðŸ˜”. PageSpeed
is really smart about compression in general, for instance, it always
[automatically enables `mod_deflate` for compression](https://www.modpagespeed.com/doc/configuration#output_filter),
optionally
[adds an `accept-encoding: gzip` header to requests that lack it](https://www.modpagespeed.com/doc/system#fetch_with_gzip),
and
[automatically `gzip`s compressable resources as they are stored in the cache](https://www.modpagespeed.com/doc/system#gzip_cache),
but Brotli support is just not there yet. The good news is that it is being
worked on,
[GitHub Issue #1148](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pagespeed-mod/issues/1148)
tracks the effort.

## Making Brotli work with PageSpeed

The even better news is that while we are waiting for native Brotli support in
PageSpeed, we can just outsource Brotli compression to the underlying webserver.
To do so, simply disable PageSpeed's HTTPCache Compression. Quoting from the
[documentation](https://www.modpagespeed.com/doc/system#gzip_cache):

> To configure cache compression, set `HttpCacheCompressionLevel` to values
> between `-1` and `9`, with `0` being off, `-1` being `gzip`'s default
> compression, and `9` being maximum compression.

ðŸ“¢ So to make PageSpeed work with Brotli, what you want in your
[`pagespeed.conf`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pagespeed-mod/blob/master/install/common/pagespeed.conf.template)
file is a new line:

```bash
# Disable PageSpeed's gzip compression, so the server's
# native Brotli compression kicks in via `mod_brotli`
# or `ngx_brotli`.
ModPagespeedHttpCacheCompressionLevel 0
```

One thing to have an eye on is server load. Brotli is more demanding than gzip,
so for your static resources, you probably want to
[serve pre-compressed content](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_brotli.html#precompressed)
wherever possible, and for the odd chance of
[when you are Facebook, maybe disable Brotli for your dynamic resources](https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/105#issuecomment-559315997).

Happy Brotli serving, and, by the way, in case you ever wondered, Brotli is a ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­
Swiss German word for a bread roll and literally means "small bread".

Some say blogging is grassroot journalism and an important part of social networking of the 21st century. Others see blogging just as a thing of egomaniacs who long for perception. Long time I belonged to the second group.<br />
<br />
How come I changed my mind? Well, this was mainly caused by one of the most human properties: <b>curiosity</b>. I love reading blogs - when they're worth reading. Nowhere else people express their meaning as honestly than on their blog. It is a great tool to find out what people really think of something. After the press reports due to the release of APIlity version 1.0.0 (<a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/63268" target="_blank">heise</a> and <a href="http://www.golem.de/0508/40079.html" target="_blank">Golem</a>) I was very interested in how people would take it on.<br />
<br />
In his <a href="http://www.nathanwhite.us/?p=7" target="_blank">blog entry about APIlity</a> Nathan White describes his thoughts and dislikes just as they came into his mind. He calls his blog entries <b>brain drippings</b> and this is what makes it so worthy. I think this was my personal "hey, blogs are good for something" experience. My blog is called <b>blogccasion</b> which describes very clearly what it is for me. A thing I can put my thoughts in <i>? l'occasion</i>, when the opportunity arises.<br />
<br />
I have strong concerns however in just using some off-the-shelf blogging software. I am <b>not blogging my life</b> as some bloggers do, but anyway, I feel bad when some third party even owns some kilobytes of it. What if the "blogger.com"s of this world go bust? Therefore I developed the blogccasion software myself, upgraded my webhosting package and there it goes...<br />
<br />
I'm passing one and a half years at France for studies and it also is a great thing to stay in contact with my friends and family. Everybody can read and comment on the things I write whenever they want - or not at all, and this is the best part. I am not annoying anyone by sending unwanted emails. Those who are interested can have a look at the blog.<br />

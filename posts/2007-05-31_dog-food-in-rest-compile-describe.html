<br />
A lot of companies, including the <a href="http://www.google.com/">one</a> I work for, are eating their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one%27s_own_dog_food">dog food</a> as a means of improving the overall quality of their products. I am planning to follow this pattern in <a href="http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html">REST Describe & Compile</a>, that is to say in the Grammars and Namespace Discoverer modules. I am thinking of a module that uses code created by REST Compile, and then executes this code in order to retrieve the namespaces and particular XML schemas a certain web service uses. So the process flow would be:<ol><li>Analyze a request URI and generate a first <b>reqest-based WADL</b></li><li>Use this WADL file to <b>generate request code</b></li><li><b>Execute the generated code</b> on the server, i.e. place a real API request</li><li>Harvest the returned response and <b>discover the contained namespaces and XML schemas</b></li><li>Refine the previously generated WADL, and <b>add the response-based WADL information</b></li><li>Return the <b>final version of the WADL</b></li><li>Return the <b>final version of the code</b> with proper response handling</li></ol>This raises the question about <i>security</i>. Is executing code on your server a good idea? How can evil requests be detected? Can someone create a request that transforms into WADL that then in turn transforms into code that harms your server? What do you think?<br />

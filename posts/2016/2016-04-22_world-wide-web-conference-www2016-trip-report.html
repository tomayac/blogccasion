  Last week, I attended the 25<sup>th</sup> International World Wide Web
  Conference (<a href="http://www2016.ca/">WWW2016</a>) that took place from
  April 11 to 15, 2016 in Montréal, Canada. The
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/forms/proceedings.htm"
    >main proceedings</a
  >
  and the
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/forms/companion.htm"
    >companion proceedings</a
  >
  are both available online. Google was one of the gold sponsors and Google
  Director of Research <a href="http://norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a> delivered
  one of the main
  <a href="http://www2016.ca/keynote-speakers.html">keynotes</a>. This is my
  trip report with personal highlights and observations.
</p>

<strong>Workshops, Day 1</strong>

<p>
  I started the conference with the
  <a href="http://microposts2016.seas.upenn.edu/">Making Sense of Microposts</a>
  workshop that began with an invited talk by Yahoo Research Scientist
  <a href="http://astro.temple.edu/~tua95067/">Mihajlo Grbovic</a> on
  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/sz7zidj7ow1b3v6/paper_15.pdf?dl=1"
    >Leveraging Blogging Activity on Tumblr to Infer Demographics and Interests
    of Users for Advertising Purposes</a
  >. As a ground truth for their gender prediction they have used US Census data
  on
  <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html"
    >popular baby names</a
  >
  and for <em>female</em> reached a precision of 0.806 (recall 0.838) and for
  <em>male</em> a precision of 0.794 (recall 0.689). I spent the rest of the day
  with session hopping between the Microposts workshop and the
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/companion/p1037.pdf"
    >Computational Social Science for the Web</a
  >
  tutorial.

<strong>Workshops, Day 2</strong>

<p>
  My second day was fully dedicated to the
  <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/wikiworkshop2016/">Wiki Workshop</a> that
  started with surprise guest and Wikipedia co-founder
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales">Jimmy Wales</a>, which led
  to a short discussion of, among other topics, payment and reward models for
  authors on <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and
  <a href="http://www.wikia.com/">Wikia</a>.

<p>
  The workshop had an interesting concept of
  <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/wikiworkshop2016/#speakers-www"
    >invited talks</a

  that filled the day, and the actual papers being presented at a poster session
  during lunch. I want to highlight the paper
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/companion/p985.pdf"
    >With a Little Help from my Neighbors: Person Name Linking Using the
    Wikipedia Social Network</a
  >

</p>

<strong>Main Conference, Day 1</strong>

<p>
  The main conference started with a keynote by
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> whose
  talk touched on the topic of mobile Web apps&mdash;which he prefers over
  native apps, because
  <q cite="https://twitter.com/dret/status/720263022531448832"
    >when [one goes] native, [one] become[s] part of a value chain</q
  >&mdash;and that Web apps need to get closer to the capabilites of native apps
  (he did not mention
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API"
    >Service Worker</a
  >
  specifically, but it was <em>somewhat</em> clear from the context that he was
  aiming at this API).
</p>

<p>
  After the keynote, I saw the presentation of a paper titled
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p51.pdf"
    >Immersive Recommendation: News and Event Recommendations Using Personal
    Digital Traces</a
  >
  on an approach to leverage cross-platform user profiles for news and event
  recommendations. The authors' <a href="http://newsfie.org/">demo</a> worked
  very well when I tested it with my
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tomayac">YouTube</a> and
  <a href="https://twitter.com/tomayac">Twitter</a> accounts.
</p>

<p>
  Next, I learned how the team at YouTube deal with spammy comments by analyzing
  the temporal graph based on the engagement behavior pattern between users and
  videos from the paper presentation of
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p111.pdf"
    >In a World That Counts: Clustering and Detecting Fake Social Engagement at
    Scale</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  An interesting idea to prevent online trackers from tracking personally
  identifiable information was shown in the paper
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p121.pdf"
    >Tracking the Trackers</a
  >
  by the makers of the Web browser <a href="https://cliqz.com/en">CLIQZ</a>.
  Their approach leverages concepts from
  <a
    href="http://dataprivacylab.org/dataprivacy/projects/kanonymity/kanonymity.pdf"
    >k-anonymity</a
  >
  by&mdash;rather than working with fixed block lists&mdash;having users
  collectively identify unsafe tracking elements in the background that have the
  potential to uniquely identify individual users, and by then removing such
  information from tracking requests.
</p>

<p>
  The paper
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p133.pdf"
    >Crowdsourcing Annotations for Websites' Privacy Policies: Can It Really
    Work?</a
  >
  tackles the issue of lengthy and hard-to-read privacy policies and whether
  crowdsourcing their annotation can help. The authors come to the conclusion
  that, if carefully deployed, crowdsourcing can indeed result in the generation
  of non-trivial annotations and can also help identify elements of ambiguity in
  policies. A <a href="https://explore.usableprivacy.org/">demo</a> with
  annotated privacy policies shows some examples.
</p>

<p>
  From the poster session, I especially liked
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/companion/p27.pdf"
    >Visual Positions of Links and Clicks on Wikipedia</a
  >
  that looked at the visual positions of clicked links on Wikipedia based on the
  <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_clickstream"
    >Wikipedia clickstream dataset</a
  >
  and
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/companion/p31.pdf"
    >Travel the World: Analyzing and Predicting Booking Behavior using E-Mail
    Travel Receipts</a
  >
  that examined more than 25 million travel receipts from Yahoo Mail users to
  predict their booking behavior.

<strong>Main Conference, Day 2</strong>

<p>
  Day 2 started with a keynote by
  <a href="https://twitter.com/mzurko">Mary Ellen Zurko</a>, Principal Engineer
  at Cisco Systems, in which she provided a tour down memory lane through
  security from <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-HTTP">S-HTTP</a> to
  <a
    href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/41927.pdf"
    >Experimenting At Scale With Google Chrome's SSL Warning</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  From the research track, I first want to highlight a Yahoo <del>Labs</del>
  <ins>Research</ins> paper on
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p299.pdf"
    >Predicting Pre-click Quality for Native Advertisements</a
  >. Native ads are defined as a specific form of online advertising, where ads
  replicate the look-and-feel of their serving platform. The authors introduce
  the notion of <em>bad ads</em> that have a high Offensive Feedback Rate (OFR),
  <em>i.e.</em>, the relation between the number of times an ad was rated
  <em>offensive</em> and the number of impressions. According to the paper, the
  OFR metrics are more reliable than the commonly used click-through rate (CTR)
  metrics.

<p>
  One of my favorite papers of the conference was
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p591.pdf"
    >Disinformation on the Web: Impact, Characteristics, and Detection of
    Wikipedia Hoaxes</a
  >
  (lighter reading:
  <a
    href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikipedia_Hoax_Detection_-_WMF_Nov_18_-_slides.pdf"
    >slides</a
  >, <a href="https://cs.umd.edu/~srijan/hoax/">project homepage</a>) that aims
  at identifying hoaxes on Wikipedia, <em>i.e.</em>, deliberately fabricated
  falsehood made to masquerade as truth. Some
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia"
    >famous hoaxes</a
  >
  survived for more than nine years and were widely cited in the media.
</p>

I continued with the presentation of our Industry Track paper
<a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p1419.pdf"
  >From Freebase to Wikidata: The Great Migration</a
>, in which we describe our ongoing data transfer project for migrating the (now
<a href="https://plus.google.com/109936836907132434202/posts/bu3z2wVqcQc"
  >shut-down</a
>) structured knowledge base <a href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a> to
<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a>. We
further report on the data mapping challenges, provide an analysis of the
progress so far, and also describe the
<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Primary_sources_tool"
  >Primary Sources Tool</a
>
that aims to facilitate this&mdash;and future&mdash;data migrations. The tool
has been released as
<a href="https://github.com/google/primarysources">open source</a>.

</p>

<p>
  For me, the day ended with an interesting paper on
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p661.pdf"
    >The QWERTY Effect on the Web&mdash;How Typing Shapes the Meaning of Words
    in Online Human-Computer Interaction</a
  >. I had never heard of the
  <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-012-0229-7"
    >QWERTY effect</a
  >
  before, but it is based on the hypothesis that on average words typed with
  more letters from the right side of the keyboard are more positive in meaning
  than words typed with more letters from the left. According to the paper,
  there is some evidence that this hypothesis also holds true for the Web.
</p>

<strong>Main Conference, Day 3</strong>

<p>
  In the paper
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p999.pdf"
    >Tell Me About Yourself: The Malicious CAPTCHA Attack</a
  >, the authors show how fake
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHAS</a>
  (<u>C</u>ompletely <u>A</u>utomated <u>P</u>ublic <u>T</u>uring tests to tell
  <u>C</u>omputers and <u>H</u>umans <u>A</u>part) can be used to trick users
  into unwillingly disclosing private information like one's Facebook name
  displayed in (social widget) <code>iframes</code> embedded in attack pages
  that do not have access to this private data due to the
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy"
    >Same Origin Policy</a
  >
  by having users solve such fake CAPTCHAs consisting of many CSS-disguised
  <code>iframe</code>s.
</p>

<p>
  Google runs a service called
  <a href="https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/safebrowsing/"
    >Safe Browsing</a
  >
  that alerts users when websites get compromised. In the paper
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p1009.pdf"
    >Remedying Web Hijacking: Notification Effectiveness and Webmaster
    Comprehension</a
  >, the authors provide a study that captures the life cycle of 760,935
  hijacking incidents from July, 2014 to June, 2015, as identified by Google
  Safe Browsing and Search Quality. They observe that direct communication with
  webmasters increases the likelihood of cleanup by over 50% and reduces
  infection lengths by at least 62%.
</p>

<p>
  Another paper on Wikipedia looked at
  <a href="http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p975.pdf"
    >Growing Wikipedia Across Languages via Recommendation</a
  >
  by detecting missing articles, ranking them by local importance, and finally
  contacting potential Wikipedia editors via email and suggesting them to write
  the article in question. The authors have deployed the
  <a href="http://recommend.wmflabs.org/#Recommend ">Wikipedia GapFinder</a>
  that shows the appraoch in practice.
</p>

<p>
  One thing I noticed at the conference is that we (and I fully include myself
  here) from time to time still tend to unconsciously use stereotyped, gendered
  language where it is inadequate in the general case ("so easy my mom or
  grandma could use it", "to pass the 'mom test'", <em>etc.</em>). I called this
  out in a
  <a href="https://twitter.com/tomayac/status/720613067822903296">tweet</a>. You
  may want to follow the interesting conversation it has started on
  <a href="https://twitter.com/tomayac/status/720613067822903296">Twitter</a> or

  (if you are friends with me). This tweet led Christopher Gutteridge to create
  the imaginative naive Web user
  <a href="http://blog.soton.ac.uk/webteam/2016/04/15/introducing-rube/">Rube</a
  >.

<b>APIlity Agua 1.13.0 Released</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.softpedia.com/screenshots/thumbs/APIlity-Agua-22795-thumb.png" align="left" hspace="5"/>It has been a long time, but finally also APIlity Agua, the <u>A</u>jax <u>GU</u>I for <u>A</u>dWords has been released into the wild. The new version <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-api-adwords-apility/downloads/detail?name=agua_1.13.0.zip">APIlity Agua 1.13.0</a> adds the latest v12/v13 features of AdWords (mainly firstPageCpc and qualityScore in KeywordCriterion objects), and speeds up Campaign and AdGroup retrieval by using the faster functions <a href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#campaign-getActiveCampaigns()">getActiveCampaigns</a> and <a href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#campaign-getActiveAdGroups()">getActiveAdGroups</a>.<br />
<br />
It is amazing how dynamic the open source scene around <a href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/">APIlity</a> is. As I was not able to work on Agua due to a two-month trip around Europe for the <a href="http://code.google.com/events/developerday/2008/">Google Developer Days 2008</a>, Marco T. has worked on an <a href="http://groups.google.de/group/adwords-api-php/msg/6d1fc7d4da4a0e12">unofficial version of APIlity Agua</a>. Hats off for this effort, and a huge "thank you", Marco! If you happen to read this blog, I'd be happy to link to your site if you have one. Just leave a comment, or drop <a href="http://www.blog.tomayac.de/index.php?date=2005-10-21&time=18:05:10&perma=Thomas+Steiner%27s+con.html&">me</a> a mail.<br />

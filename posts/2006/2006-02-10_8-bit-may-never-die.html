<b>8-Bit May Never Die!</b><br />
<br />
My parents never allowed me to have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console">video game console</a> and I am glad they didn't. I still grew up climbing real trees and collecting real mushrooms. My hope is that I can <b>educate my own kids without consoles, cell phones and stuff</b> as well.<br />
<br />
However, like all kids that didn't have their own NES, I knew some other kid who had one.  So from time to time I enjoyed myself playing Super Mario till I fell in some volcano lava and had to pass the joypad over to the next kid (actually I think I never played any longer than 2 or 3 minutes...).<br />
<br />
Today there is still a lot of stuff about the 8-Bit era around on the web. <a href="http://www.micromusic.net/">Low-tech music for high-tech people</a> is a good example. But what made me really rolling on the floor laughing was the following <a href="http://unf-unf.de/show1050.html">Super Mario performance from some crazy high-school kids</a> <small><span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">? really worth a click!</span></small>. Also a must-see: the ultimate <a href="http://redruth.greenbean.org/~ben/4CR/smb_super_synth.swf">Super Mario Synthesizer (Flash)</a>.<br />

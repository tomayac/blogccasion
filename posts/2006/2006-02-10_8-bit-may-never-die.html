<b>8-Bit May Never Die!</b><br />
<br />
My parents never allowed me to have a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console">video game console</a>
and I am glad they didn't. I still grew up climbing real trees and collecting
real mushrooms. My hope is that I can
<b>educate my own kids without consoles, cell phones and stuff</b> as well.<br />
<br />
However, like all kids that didn't have their own NES, I knew some other kid who
had one. So from time to time I enjoyed myself playing Super Mario till I fell
in some volcano lava and had to pass the joypad over to the next kid (actually I
think I never played any longer than 2 or 3 minutesâ€¦).<br />
<br />
Today there is still a lot of stuff about the 8-Bit era around on the web.

/><b>R.I.P. Alturo - Switching my web hoster</b><br />
<br />
With the re-structuring of
<a href="http://www.united-internet.de/">United Internet</a>, my former web
hoster <a href="http://alturo.de">Alturo</a> has been shut down. According to
the company, the market has changed enormously, and prices have gone down. Thus,
the brand could no longer be maintained in a profit-making way.<br />
<br />
Alturo offers its former customers the possibility to move to
<a href="http://1und1.de">1&1</a>, another sub-company of United Internet. After
a quick evaluation of the present web hosting market, I found other companies
offering the same features (MySQL database, PHP, SSH, FTP upload, CGIs) either
for a bit less, or a lot more than I was paying before. Basically, there are
<b>many discounters offering very attractive and cheap hosting packages</b>, and
there are
<b
  >established and well-known companies offering not very attractive and quite
  limited packages for a lot of money</b
>.<br />
<br />
Finally, I decided to accept the Alturo offer (<a
  href="http://www.1und1.info/xml/order/HostingHome"
  >1&1 Home</a
>), now paying almost double the price I paid before, and getting almost the
same list of features, however, only 1/3 of the web space I had before. Anyway,
maybe I am getting wise, old and conservative, but I need to confess that
quality has its price, and I am now willing to pay it. Hopefully I will not need
to switch my hosting provider again, and hopefully you have read the
'me-getting-wise' part, Dadâ€¦

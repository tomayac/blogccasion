<b>French-German Quaero project no longer French-German</b><br />
<br />
On today's Potsdam IT Summit a representative of the German ministry of
economics has announced that the French-German cooperation for research and
development of European search engine technology is history. According to the
ministry representative (Hartmut Schauerte) the cooperation "has not been easy".
While the French side was trying to develop a European alternative (some people
might say <i>a French rival</i>) to the US companies Google and Microsoft, the
German side was trying to do fundamental research for the semantic web, without
the goal to compete with existing market leaders.<br />
<br />
<b>French-German issues</b><br />
<br />
For me, being German and (still) studying in France, the situation is totally
evident. I hit French-German issues on a daily basis. In my opinion France never
got over the fact of no longer being a world power. Many French still think of
France like the center of the world. This may be true for wine, but certainly
not for world-leading software products. The problem however is totally
home-made: how do you want to sell your products world-wide when your code is
completely programmed in French? This is the way French engineering students are
being educated. And how on earth do you want to succeed on the world markets if
50% of the country's <i>elite</i> students have a less than basic level of
English? Try to sell your stuff in French?<br />
<br />
<b>The French understanding of the IT market</b><br />
<br />
This obviously does not work, so French companies are mainly focussing the
French market. As a matter of fact English is the <i>lingua franca</i> of the IT
world. There are some French that have understood and accepted this (maybe)
bitter truth, but for the rest it is a mentality thing. People like Chirac (who
initiated the project in April 2005) still dream of a world adapting to France,
and not France adapting to the world. To me as a grad student who will very soon
hold a French and a German degree, at present France is not an attractive place.
<b>Closed-minded</b> is a harsh word, but it is pretty much my impression of the
French way of understanding the IT market. Starting at engineering schools, and
ending at the abandonment of the Quaero project. For the ones it is Euro-Google,
for the others it is a future semantic web research project.<br />

<b>Five things about Europe I miss while in the US</b><br />
<br />
<ol><li>Reliable <b>public transportation</b>, or public transportation at all. In the US, at least in California, without a car you are lost. There is <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/">Caltrain</a>, the railway from San Francisco to San Jose, there is <a href="http://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> (<u>B</u>ay <u>A</u>rea <u>R</u>apid <u>T</u>ransit) which connects San Francisco with the East Bay, but there are very few buses. On many stops there is no timetable, so you never know if there is even a vague chance of a bus within the next two hours. However, the buses that exist have bike racks, so you can even ride your bike on the bus.<br />
<br />
<u>Rating:</u> <span style="background-color:yellow">Hopeful</span>, but still a long way to go.</li><br />
<li>Milk without <b>added vitamin D</b>, and chips that do not claim to contain no <b>trans fats</b>. Before my stay in the US I did not even know about the existence of <a href="http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11091">trans fats</a> and I did not care much about vitamin D. Now I cannot even buy pure, simple, elementary milk.<br />
<br />
<u>Rating:</u> <span style="background-color:red">Hopeless</span>, the food industry has way too much power.</li><br />
<li>The right to <b>drink a beer without the obligation to put a brown paper bag around the bottle</b>. The law of the open bottle says that it is illegal to drink alcohol on public places. You may not even drive with <u>empty</u> cans or bottles in your car. The drinking age is 21 in most states.<br />
<br />
<u>Rating:</u> <span style="background-color:yellow">Hypocritical</span>, moderate drinking in public should not be illegal.</li><br />
<li>The <b>smell of tobacco after eating in a restaurant</b> or visiting a club. California has one of the most advanced anti-smoking laws in the world. Smokers are banned from workplaces, restaurants, bars, clubsâ€¦ It took me a while to understand why many bars are crowded on the outside and not the inside.<br />
<br />
<u>Rating:</u> <span style="color:white; background-color:green">Awesome</span>, I wish Europe would be that far already.</li><br />
<li>A <b>clear distinction of who is a cop, and who is just a security guy</b>. Very often I cannot tell the difference between the different uniforms and cars. Who has governmental authority, and who has not? May a private security crew put a drunk guy in a police-like looking car and drive him off? I simply do not know, but I guess they would have weak arguments before court. However, security 'arresting' people to my attention happens quite often.<br />
<br />
<u>Rating:</u> <span style="background-color:red">Sad</span>, private security becomes more and more normal</span>.</li></ol>

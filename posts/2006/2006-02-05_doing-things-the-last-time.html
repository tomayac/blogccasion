/><b>Sunday, gloomy sunday</b><br />
<br />
In a world which currently burns embassies for
<a href="http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/698/">Mohammed caricatures</a>, I
am sitting in front of my PC, listening to the great life album
<a href="http://www.countingcrows.com/discography/aaw/index.html"
  >Across the Wire</a
>
from <a href="http://www.countingcrows.com/">Counting Crows</a>, dreaming of an
eskimo and thinking. How does it feel when you know that you're really doing
something for the last time? For example being 80 and visiting say the ocean for
the last time in your life? 80 years like my grandpa who unfortunately is far
from going anywhere else than around in the four walls he is living in. He is
1/1 bald, my dad is 1/2 bald, I am 7/8 (pessimistic estimation) bald. Inspired
by the image on the right, I decided to wear my hair long for the last time in
my life. Sorry for being sentimental, sometimes it's just even fun. Especially
when being in love and knowing that some things - like hair - just don't
count…<br />

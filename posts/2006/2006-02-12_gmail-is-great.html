<b>Archiving my email with Gmail and labels</b><br />
<br />
Today I archived my old email. My
<b>first (still stored) email dates back to 1998</b>. I have stored my
correspondence in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">mbox format</a>, first using
Netscape, then Mozilla and today Thunderbird. With Gmail's great search
technique and the more than 2 gigabyte of memory I thought it was just great to
really have all mails accessible online.<br />
<br />
Question is: <b>how to get the email in Gmail</b>? Therefore I discovered Mark
Lyon's simple, multi-platform
<a href="http://www.marklyon.org/gmail/download.htm">Gmail Loader</a> whose only
purpose is to
<ol>
  <li>read an mbox file</li>
  <li>forward all the emails contained to a Gmail account</li>
</ol>
Forwarding the email comes along with the
<b>inconvenience of all the original sent dates being lost</b> (the dates are
kept inside the mail text). Being given the opportunities I have, this is a
compromise I can live with.<br />
<br />
A feature I considered kind of useless are
<a href="http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2005/01/25/Gmail.html"
  >Gmail labels</a
>. Till this day. With labels you can
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tags">tag semantic information</a> to each
mail. Now I just love labels like 'Friends', 'Work', 'Family', â€¦ They help me
organize my mail and simply make my life easier.<br />

/><b>Pandora and the Music Genome Project</b><br />
<br />
Ever dreamt of a <i>skip</i> key on your radio? Or ever dreamt of a radio that
just plays your <i>favorite tunes</i>? You have thousands of MP3s but just
cannot find the one that fits your current mood?<br />
<br />
Being given that in many cases your best music comes from a CD you have borrowed
from a friend of yours who suggested it to you, the
<a href="http://www.pandora.com/corporate/mgp.shtml">Music Genome Project</a>
upscales this social network of suggestions in order to fulfill these dreams. In
January 2000, a group of musicians and technicians founded the project with the
ambitious goal to
<b>"capture the essence of music at the fundamental level"</b>. Therefore the
people involved in the project created more than 400 attributes to characterize
a song, like
<i>melody, harmony, instrumentation, rhythm, vocals, lyrics</i> etc. Each song
is analyzed for about 20 to 30 minutes to extract the little details that make
it individual. Afterwards the song gets integrated into the social network of
related songs. By now, this is nothing special yet as automatized music analysis
called <b>"Music Data Mining"</b> is a relatively old field of research.<br />
<br />
The idea becomes vital when human interaction is added. This can be done by
tagging semantic information to each song.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">Tagging</a> is one of the Web
2.0's key ingredients. The internet's biggest site for tagged music is
<a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">musicbrainz.org</a>. The Music Genome Project
combines the two technologies of man-made tags and computer-generated song
relationships. Each user of the project's data can
<i>suggest his favorite tracks to be added</i> to the database. In addition to
that, each user can also <i>rate the songs</i> and therewith weaken or
strengthen each song's position in the relationship network. The more users
contribute to this system, the more representative becomes the song's
positioning in the network.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> is a Flash-based player
application that provides an interactive interface to the Music Genome database.
You can trigger your trip into the database by typing a song or band name in the
input form and then browse the network, be it interactively by rating, skipping
and bookmarking, or be it in a web radio style by just leaning back and enjoying
music you never might have heard of before. I just wished they had an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a>. According to an

(French) there are plans to offer one in future. I am looking forward to it.<br />

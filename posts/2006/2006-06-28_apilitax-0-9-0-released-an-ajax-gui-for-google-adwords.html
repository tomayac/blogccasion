<b>APIlitAx 0.9.0 released, An Ajax GUI for Google AdWords</b><br />
<br />
Today, I am happy to announce the release of
<a href="http://apilitax.sourceforge.net/">APIlitAx</a>, an Ajax GUI for AdWords
based on the <a href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net">APIlity</a> library
which allows you to very easily manage your Google AdWords accounts in an
interactive and "multi-threaded" manner. APIlitAx is released under the BSD
license. This allows you to use the application in your proprietary products.<br />
<br />
However, APIlitAx and APIlity both being open source products, I hope that users
will continue to contribute their ideas and extensions in order to make the two
products even better. APIlitAx has a modularized structure, allowing new modules
being easily added. Such modules might be a report generator, the keyword tool,
the traffic estimator etc. If you are interested in working on one of these
parts, just

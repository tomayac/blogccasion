<b>APIlitAx 0.9.0 released, An Ajax GUI for Google AdWords</b><br />
<br />
Today, I am happy to announce the release of <a href="http://apilitax.sourceforge.net/">APIlitAx</a>, an Ajax GUI for AdWords based on the <a href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net">APIlity</a> library which allows you to very easily manage your Google AdWords accounts in an interactive and "multi-threaded" manner. APIlitAx is released under the BSD license. This allows you to use the application in your proprietary products.<br />
<br />
However, APIlitAx and APIlity both being open source products, I hope that users will continue to contribute their ideas and extensions in order to make the two products even better. APIlitAx has a modularized structure, allowing new modules being easily added. Such modules might be a report generator, the keyword tool, the traffic estimator etc. If you are interested in working on one of these parts, just <a href="https://blog.tomayac.com/index.php?date=2005-10-22&time=18:05:10&perma=Thomas+Steiner%27s+con.html">email me</a>.<br />
<br />
Some <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=167332">screenshots</a> and a non-working <a href="http://apilitax.sourceforge.net/demo/index.php">dummy version of APIlitAx</a> are available on the project site.<br />
<br />
The application can be <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/apilitax/apilitax_0.9.0.zip?download">downloaded</a> from SourceForge for free. Your feedback or any contribution is warmly welcomed (just drop a comment here, or use the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adwords-api-php/browse_thread/thread/1eb494e15dc527f5">forum</a>).

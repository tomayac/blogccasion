/><b>Mashup Camp 2</b><br />
<br />
On July 12th and 13th 2006 I attended the second
<a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/">Mashup Camp</a> in Mountain View,
California in the Computer History Museum, just a 10 minute walk away from
Google. A short and handy
<a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/faq#Q1">definition of mashup</a> is
available on the programmable web homepage. The atmosphere on the camp was very
geeky and '2.0'-y, very open and democratic.

/>A good example of this atmosphere is the schedule board for the sessions and
discussions. It is kind of funny that a hightech conference is organized on
paper. I think there are some fields where computers never will be able to
replace paper. Anyway, the sessions people offered where posted on a schedule
board, and then re-arranged on demand. People had a quite good feeling of how
many people their session would attract, and thus scheduled their sessions in
the appropriate rooms.<br />
<br />
People showed off a lot of really cool mashups:
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://frucall.com/">Frucall</a>, a free voice call best price
    finder
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://weatherbonk.com/">Weather Bonk</a>, a mashup of Google Maps
    and weather forecast feeds
  </li>
  <li>
    The in my opinion funniest mashup was an image captcha consisting of a 3x3
    matrix of <a href="http://www.hotornot.com/">hot or not</a> images. In order
    to pass as a human being, the user had to click the three hottest images. It
    worked surprisingly well. However, the captcha might not be politically
    correctâ€¦
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
I presented a mashup of Google AdWords and Google Checkout called
<b>Checkout APIlitAx</b>. The relationship of AdWords and Checkout is quite
obvious. My example was a t-shirt shop where a shop vendor could automatically
create ads based on his inventory list. The ads were then linked to products of
the vendor's inventory. The mashup uses the
<a href="http://apilitax.sourceforge.net/">APIlitAx</a> infrastructure to
perform AdWords operations, and accesses the
<a href="https://code.google.com/apis/checkout/">Checkout API</a> via PHP. I
will shortly release it as an open source project.<br />

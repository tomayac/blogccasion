/><b>Dear APIlity users,</b><br />
<br />
Thanks to a bug report from Maciej Marczuk, I could finally reproduce<br />
the "This account is empty" error which some users reported. The<br />
problem is based on the way PHP treats empty or unset variables in the<br />
Linux and Windows version of PHP. In some very specific cases (OS, PHP<br />
configuration and especially the particular AdWords account contents),<br />
this behaviour caused APIlity to think an account was empty, even if it<br />
was not, and made the script stop.<br />

To avoid further confusions, I have improved the error message in case<br />
of the attempt to access an "empty" account (where "empty" means that<br />
an account contains no, or only deleted Campaigns). I apologize for the<br />
inconvenieces this bug has caused. Mea maxima culpaâ€¦ This hotfix<br />

Hope this helps and finally fixes the problem. If not, please let me<br />
know. Thanks.<br />

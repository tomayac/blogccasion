<b>How Google really works</b><br />
Ever wondered how Google creates its impressive results? Now as I am directly on
site, I finally understand. Google employs a whole bunch of interns (like me)
whose only day job is to enter the millions of search queries from the Google
web search interface into Yahoo, wait for the results, sreen-scrape the data and
have them nicely layouted be pushed out to the searcher. Of course this approach
has its shortcomings. Only think of the popular "did you mean <i>abc</i>?"
feature. You really need to be an expert in linguistics and tech stuff at the
same time. If you are up for a great challenge, do not hesitate to apply for one
of the cool <a href="https://www.google.com/jobs">jobs on Google</a>, and enjoy
the Google swimming pool, the sun terrace and the barbecues with Larry and
Sergej (everybody always talks about those two guys, I think they kind of
started the Internet or something).

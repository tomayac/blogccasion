      $campaignObject->toXml()</code
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed the getCsvReport() function which was broken in the last release.
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a small bug in ->getAdGroupData() where an attribute was wrong.</li>
  <li>
    Fixed a small bug in ->getCriterionData() where an attribute was missing.

  >RDFa API-based Creative Commons Laser Highlighter Chrome Extension
  Released</b
><br />
<br />
I have released a very early alpha state pure JavaScript implementation of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-api/">RDFa API draft spec</a>. It has still
many flaws, but at this stage it's already usable enough to be the foundation
for a Chrome extension: the
<a href="http://bit.ly/rdfalaser">RDFa Creative Commons Laser Highlighter</a>.
Rather than calling <span style="font-family: monospace">document.*</span> you
call <span style="font-family: monospace">LinkedData.API.*</span> (I've put the
API in my own namespace to avoid confusion with potential native
implementations, and yepp, I do vote for renaming the API). I have coded an
extension around
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-api/#data-based-web-page-modification"
  >example 1.3</a
>
from the current draft spec. The whole magic happens in just two calls:
<pre>LinkedData.API.data.context.setMapping(<br />
   'cc',<br />
   'http://creativecommons.org/ns#');<br />
LinkedData.API.getElementsByProperty('cc:license');</pre>
The extension is more or less just a toy, but the provided JavaScript code
should already be good enough to test the examples in the latest spec draft. The
library is implemented using XPath and not at all intended to be fast, or
elegant, and currently just supports RDFa and has many of the advanced API calls
mocked out. I'm happy to keep improving the code if anyone is interested. Just
let me know.<br />

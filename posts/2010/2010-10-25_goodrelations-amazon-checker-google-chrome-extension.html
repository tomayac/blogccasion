<b>GoodRelations Amazon Checker Google Chrome Extension</b><br />
<br />
During the past weeks I have been busy with a pure JavaScript implementation of
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-api/">RDFa API</a> (the specification is
currently in draft status). RDFa is a way to embed semantic data into websites.
This allows for adding e.g. the information that the number 5.99 actually is a
price of an item with a certain name "item x". If you have never heard of RDFa,
you can read the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa Primer</a> document
published by the W3C. In order to semantically mark-up information, a so-called
ontology or vocabulary is necessary. For products or offerings that you can
order via the Internet a common ontology is
<a href="http://www.heppnetz.de/projects/goodrelations/">GoodRelations</a> by
Martin Hepp (<a href="http://twitter.com/mfhepp">@mfhepp</a>). For retailers
this is quite interesting as their product data might be interlinked and
featured by search engines (see
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mhepp">Martin Hepp's presentations</a> for a
bigger picture). In my recent Chrome extensions spree I have coded yet another
very simple Chrome extension called
<a
  href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jlfealjceojnflopgcelhcmghpakmklk"
  >GoodRelations Amazon Checker</a
>
that allows for checking whether a GoodRelations-marked-up product from a
website is available on Amazon.<br />

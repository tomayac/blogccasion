<b>SEKI@home, or Crowdsourcing an Open Knowledge Graph</b><br />
<br />
In May 2012, the Web search engine Google has introduced the so-called Knowledge Graph, a graph that understands real-world entities and their relationships to one another. It currently contains more than 500 million objects, as well as more than 3.5 billion facts about and relationships between these different objects. Soon after its announcement, people started to ask for a Knowledge Graph Application Programming Interface (API), however, as of today, Google does not provide one. With <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pcpnfphfckcddgdbgjpfdifnmfjcpcae/">SEKI@home</a>, which stands for Search for Embedded Knowledge Items, we propose a browser extension-based approach to crowdsource such an API. As people with the extension installed search on Google.com, the extension sends extracted anonymous Knowledge Graph facts from Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) to a centralized, publicly accessible triple store, and thus over time creates a SPARQL-queryable <a href="http://openknowledgegraph.org/">Open Knowledge Graph</a>. The SPARQL endpoint for the Open Knowledge Graph is available at <a href="http://openknowledgegraph.org/sparql">http://openknowledgegraph.org/sparql</a>. This prototype browser extension is tailored to the Google Knowledge Graph, however, we note that the concept of SEKI@home is generalizable for other knowledge bases.<br />
<br />
A paper describing the technical details of this extension has been submitted to the First International Workshop on <a href="http://blogs.ecs.soton.ac.uk/knowledgeextraction/">Knowledge Extraction and Consolidation from Social Media</a> (KECSM2012).<br />
<br />
The extension was mainly developed by <a href="https://plus.google.com/110953903733734244143/about">Stefan Mirea</a>, steven.mirea (at) gmail [dot] com.<br />

<small>Disclaimer: the Open Knowledge Graph API and SPARQL endpoint are in NO way associated with Google. Make fair use of it.</small>

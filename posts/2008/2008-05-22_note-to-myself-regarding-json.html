<b>Note to myself regarding JSON</b><br />
<br />
I have been fiddling around with the
<a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> notation for a project at Google using
<a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a>'s implementation of a
JSON encoder/decoder called <a href="http://www.json.org/json2.js">json2.js</a>.
JSON is at an interesting point in its life since its "invention". It is widely
used, browsers can interpret it with
<span style="font-family: monospace; color: red"
  >eval('(' + jsonString + ')');</span
>. Firefox 2 kind of supports JSON encoding with
<span style="font-family: monospace; color: red">Object.toSource();</span> which
is not supported on other browsers, though. Firefox 3 ships with a native JSON
implementation (see John Resig's blog entry on the
<a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/the-state-of-json/">state of JSON</a> for more
details). One of the problems this situation brings along is the general dilemma
with whether it is a good idea or not to extend the prototypes of objects in
JavaScript. Think of an extension like
<span style="font-family: monospace; color: red">Object.prototype.toJSON</span>.
If one day browser vendors would ship with a native JSON implementation using
the same name, users would be forced to live with the overridden version, a
"slow" pure JavaScript implementation, rather than a "fast" native
implementation. Douglas Crockford chose this approach in the first place (<a
  href="http://www.json.org/json.js"
  >json.js</a
>). It has been fixed with a global JSON object in the current release
json2.js.<br />
<br />
<b>JSON is not forgiving</b><br />
Is this correct JSON?<br />
<span style="font-family: monospace; color: red"
  >{<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;'name': 'Lena',<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;'location': 'Hamburg'<br />
  }</span
><br />
It <i>is</i> correct object literal notation in JavaScript, but
<i>not</i> correct JSON. The difference is minimal, but makes JSON parsers like
the above json2.js fail. The correct form is<br />
<span style="font-family: monospace; color: red"
  >{<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Lena",<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;"location": "Hamburg"<br />
  }<br /> </span
><br />
Note the quotes ["] that must be used (and not single apostrophes [']). Good to
have picky tools like <a href="http://www.jsonlint.com/">JSONLint</a>. If you
use JSON, and if you experience strange errors, then lint your JSON, and most
likely you will bang your head against a wall afterwards.

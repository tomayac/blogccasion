It has been online for three weeks now, but for those of you who have not seen
it yet: on January 15th, 2008 I have demo'ed
<a href="http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html"
  >REST Describe & Compile</a
>
during one of Google's
<a href="https://youtube.com/user/googletechtalks">Tech Talk</a> sessions in the
head quarters in Mountain View, California.<br />
<br />
While the live audience in the room was three (3) people, the online audience in
YouTube is way bigger, and there are already first promising synergies:
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Joni Kähärä</b> from Finland has started working on a
    <b>code generator for JavaScript</b>. His first thinkings are
    <a
      href="http://sivuraide.blogspot.com/2008/02/todo-rest-describe-compile-javascript.html"
      >available on Joni's blog</a
    >. While this is definitely a cool project, it raises a question that does
    not occur in other programming languages: due to the same origin policy
    JavaScript can just access files, well, from the same origin as the original
    page. In order to gain more freedom, a local proxy is the most common
    work-around (e.g.
    <a
      href="http://developer.yahoo.com/javascript/samples/proxy/php_proxy_simple.txt"
      >Yahoo's simple PHP proxy</a
    >). I am looking forward to seeing Joni make progress on this. Great work,
    man!
  </li>
  <li>
    The second synergy for sure is not because of the Tech Talk, but I wanted to
    mention it anyway: the guys behind the Web Service <b>mashup tool</b>
    <a href="http://openkapow.com/Default.aspx">openkapow</a> now have WADL
    export for all of their REST robots. See for example the
    <a href="http://service.openkapow.com/hasin/babelfishenglishtofrench.wadl"
      >WADL for Babelfish translation</a
    >. You can retrieve the WADL from their site, and then upload it to REST
    Describe & Compile, and have your code generated on the fly. Enters
    <i>Mr. Murphy</i>: this does not work with the provided Babelfish example,
    as some of the parameter names contain spaces. Seems like I have to handle
    this case in the code… I did not even think of someone assigning a name that
    contains spaces <span style="font-face: monospace"><nobr>:-O</nobr></span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="border: dashed red 1px">
  YouTube has embedding disabled for the Tech Talks, but you can
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ2EtAEBpq0"
    >watch the talk directly on YouTube</a
  >.

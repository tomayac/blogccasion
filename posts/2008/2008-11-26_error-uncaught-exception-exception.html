<b>Error: uncaught exception: [Exception… "Component returned failure code: 0x805e000a [nsIXMLHttpRequest.open]"</b><br />
<br />
Have you ever stumbled upon this error: an XMLHttpRequest fails with the mysterious message<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family:monospace;color:darkblue;">Error: uncaught exception: [Exception… "Component returned failure code: 0x805e000a [nsIXMLHttpRequest.open]"</span><br />
<br />
The weird thing is that the same page works just fine in any other browser than Firefox/Mozilla. The solutions probably is: turn off <a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/">Adblock Plus</a> temporarily for the page. Worked like a charm for me. Hope this saves someone else some time…

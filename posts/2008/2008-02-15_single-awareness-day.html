<b>Single Awareness Day</b><br />
<br />
Besides the flour shop and chocolates mafia celebrating Valentine's Day, there is also another holiday on February 14th that I would like to point you to: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singles_Awareness_Day">Single Awareness Day</a>. No roses, no Belgian pralin√©s, just you, your unshaved legs, Dirty Dancing, and the good feeling that no one will complain about your shit-facedness after a couple of proseccos.<br />
<br />
No, I am not single, but I just hate Valentine's Day. And again, no, above I do not describe how <i>my</i> Single Awareness Day would be. Happy SAD!

<b>Sweet 1000 Miles Away Melancholy</b><br />
<br />
My new job requires me to travel a lot. Sometimes I even feel like too much. In the last time it has been about 1.x two day trips or longer per week. I spend a lot of time on air planes and I definitely know what globalization feels like. More and more I do know my way around in London's Heathrow, and I feel like I could almost lead Japanese tourists through <i>El Prat</i> Barcelona airport.<br />
<br />
With all the security checks stress and people rushing to their planes last second (including me), I really enjoy the current boarding music in Air Berlin flights. It took me three flights to <ul><li>during the first realize how good this simple piece of music can relax you,</li><li>during the second flight to really listen to the lyrics and try to understand, and finally</li><li>during the the third flight to google and verify the artist.</li></ul>So to all you frequent flyers: Air Berlin's boarding music is <b>Hey There Delilah</b> from the <b>Plain White T's</b>. I think it is rather illegal, but anyway, as long as the music video is still up you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/h_m-BjrxmgI">watch it on YouTube</a>:<br />

I really like the lyrics, it is this kind of sweet <i>1000 mile away</i> melancholy that can either completely smack you down, or perfectly turn you up, depending on the mood you are in. I have spoken to my wonderful little family just before writing this blog post via video-enabled Skype and perfect sound quality and stuff, but man, it is still the half European continent between us. Good to have music like this to listen to:<br />
<br />
<div style="padding:0.3em;background-color:#DDDDDD;">Don't you worry about the distance<br />
I'm right there if you get lonely<br />
Give this song another listen<br />
Close your eyes<br />
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise<br />
I'm by your side</div><br />
<br />
We are currently searching for an apartment in Hamburg, Germany, so I am even travelling more than usual. As there are still two weeks left until we actually have to move there from Barcelona, Spain, and we still don't have no apartment not, I just love the naive optimism of the song:<br />
<br />
<div style="padding:0.3em;background-color:#DDDDDD;">Hey there Delilah<br />
I know times are getting hard<br />
But just believe me, girl<br />
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar<br />
We'll have it good<br />
We'll have the life we knew we would</div><br />
<br />
Family, so this is my message to you: even if it seems like hopeless, we will make it there. And if I have to play the guitar in the subwayâ€¦ <span style="font-family:monospace">&lt;3</span>

<b>Persistent Storage JavaScript Library</b><br />
<br />
The last few weeks I have been working on a gadget framework that allows for
<a href="https://www.google.com/apis/adwords/">AdWords API</a> data to be
accessed from within the <a href="https://www.google.com/ig">iGoogle</a> gadget
infrastructure. I was looking for ways to store data persistently across
sessions, and for
<a
  href="/index.php?date=2007-10-17&time=01:35:43&perma=Back+from+parental+l.html"
  >obvious reasons</a
>
thought of using <a href="https://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a>. A
shortcoming of Gears is that it is not as widespread as it could be. Then I
stumbled upon a
<a
  href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/persistjs-cross-browser-client-side-persistent-storage"
  >blog entry in Ajaxian</a

about PersistJS, a JavaScript library that promised persistent storage
independent from the storage mechanism. Basically a high-level browser storage
API. Having read through the post, I went to
<a href="http://pablotron.org/?cid=1557">Paul Duncan's web page</a> and
downloaded the
<a href="http://pablotron.org/files/persist-js-0.1.0.tar.gz">PersistJS code</a
>.<br />
<br />
The library is <b>ridiculously easy</b> to use while still being
<b>perfectly elegant</b>. It detects the available storage possibilities and
goes for the first available one. Usage is as simple as (copied from the page
above):<br />
<span style="font-family: monospace; color: red"
  ><br />
  <span style="color: darkgreen"
    >// create a new client-side persistent data store</span
  ><br />
  var store = new Persist.Store('My Data Store');<br />
  <br />
  <span style="color: darkgreen">// pretend data</span><br />
  var data = "pretend this is really long data that won't fit in a cookie";<br />
  <br />
  <span style="color: darkgreen">// save data in store</span><br />
  store.set('saved_data', data);<br />
  <br />
  <span style="color: darkgreen"
    >// get data back from store, and prompt user with it</span
  ><br />
  store.get('saved_data', function(ok, val) {<br />
  if (ok)<br />
  alert('saved data = ' + val);<br />
  });<br />
  <br />
  <span style="color: darkgreen">// remove data from store</span><br />
  store.remove('saved_data');</span
><br />
<br />
I love the way this falls back to the greatest common divisor, namely cookies.
And probably the best thing about the library is that it does not detect
browsers, but browser capabilities. This way it defaults to native
implementations like
<a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:Storage">globalStorage</a> if
these get implemented in later/other browser(s) versions. Kudos to Paul Duncan
and thanks for sharing this!

<b>Two good JavaScript Books</b><br />
<br />
I have read many books on JavaScript in my life as a JavaScript coder. Actually, my first "book" about this programming language was the excellent online compendium <a href="http://de.selfhtml.org/">SELFHTML</a>. This was at the time where validating e-mail addresses with JavaScript was already quite cool, but moving things around with JavaScript was the ultimate icing on the cake. I remember my own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a> interpreter that I did as a high school projectâ€¦<br />

The Definitive Guide" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uHjFsJzpL._SL500_AA240_.jpg" style="float: right;" width="100" hspace="4" /></a> Anyway, things have changed a bit, I no longer work on <i>scripts</i>, but rather whole <i>applications</i>. And while I still do love SELFHTML for the quick access with random JavaScript doubts, I have really learnt to understand this programming language from Douglas Crockford's <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0596517742?ie=UTF8&tag=blogccasion-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=0596517742">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>, after having read David Flanagan's <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0596101996?ie=UTF8&tag=blogccasion-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=0596101996">JavaScript. The Definitive Guide</a>, also referred to as the <i>Rhino Book</i>. In the latter I especially liked Flanagan's attempts to emulate classes in JavaScript. So if you want to do something good for yourself or someone else who reads your code, go learn some JavaScript over Christmas!<br />

<b>Did you think that you were dreaming? - Sometimes I don't know…</b><br />
<p>
  It has been a long day, and it has been a long week, too. We finally have
  arrived in Hamburg, Germany, and, at least for the moment, have left
  Barcelona, Spain, behind us. We live in a nice neighborhood in a beautiful
  suburb of Hamburg named

    >Winterhude</a
  >.

  <b>Many things have changed</b>. I am no longer working from home, in contrast
  Laura now is. Our baby daughter Lena slowly adapts to the new climate and the
  different environment (Laura takes a little longer), and finally we are close
  to un-boxing all our stuff after the move. Fun things happen, like IKEA
  delivering a small closet to the wrong person, which results in the person
  being so happy about the unexpected piece of furniture that she wants to keep
  it and buy us a new one this coming Friday. Seriously, we are looking forward
  to finally mounting it on the weekend…

  <b>Some things keep being the same</b>. For example I am still travelling a
  lot for work. Today I am in London. Had some fun with the booked and confirmed
  hotel eventually being over-booked, and have now been relocated to a hotel
  close to Tower Bridge. 10<sup>th</sup> floor, beautiful view (sorry for the
  crappy cell phone camera picture):

  Life is good, though, however full of surprises and unexpected detours. Good
  that with all the London stress, the airport hectic pace, and the loved ones
  being far away and without even a phone connection for the moment, there is
  still good music to relax with and think of perfectly lucky moments.

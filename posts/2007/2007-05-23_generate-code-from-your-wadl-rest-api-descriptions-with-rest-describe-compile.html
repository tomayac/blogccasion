With today's
<a href="http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html"
  >v0.2 release of REST Describe & Compile</a
>
I hope that some more people will respond to this comment with
<i>yes, it is</i>. The new version allows for
<ul>
  <li><b>WADL creation</b> based on sample request(s)</li>
  <li><b>WADL editing</b> using an advanced interactive editor</li>
  <li>
    <b>Code generation</b> based on a WADL file which may be
    <ul>
      <li>either created by REST Describe based on sample request(s),</li>
      <li>or uploaded from an external source into REST Describe</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
At present code generation is limited to PHP, however, the architecture is
completely modular so that generators can be easily added. For the next release
it is planned to support Java, Python, Ruby, and C# (currently the corresponding
buttons are grayed out). In the following I will describe the changes and new
features in some more detail:<br />
<br />

<b>WADL feature support almost complete</b><br />

>The new version has almost complete feature support for WADL. In the REST
Describe WADL editor the <b>degree of freedom has greatly increased</b> which
means that a lot of hard-wired code from the last release has been generalized.
Now you can modify your WADL file completely interactively, with
context-sensitive behavior of the editor. For example
<span style="font-family: monospace">&lt;param&gt;</span> elements adapt their
available features depending on their parent node, and each object let's you
just add the particularly allowed sub-objects. This helps you create valid
WADLs. The idea of the editor is to mix the properties of a syntax-highlighted
XML file, a tree, and all this enriched by WADL-specific features like the type
estimation with a custom types manager.<br />
<br />
<b>WADL Parser allows for editing of existing descriptions</b><br />
<br />

>The more WADL will gain interest with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RESTafarian">RESTafarians</a>, the more
WADL files will get written. The v0.2 parsing feature allows you to
<b>upload any WADL out there</b> in this crazy world, edit it in the REST
Describe application, or even create code from it. When you check out WADL
uploading be sure to give the
<a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/wadl.rb/delicious.wadl"
  >del.icio.us WADL</a
>
a try (it is hard-coded as a demo in the WADL Upload dialog, you need to adapt
the version available on the referenced web site). Once you hit the OK button
the file gets parsed, a tree gets created, and then you can play with the file,
create code from it, or even save it and then upload it again (this was my test
to see whether the parsing feature worked). Parsed files will show up in
fullscreen mode, but of course you can easily leave this mode if you feel
like.<br />
<br />
<b>More RESTful behavior</b><br />
<br />

>Even if most REST APIs are somewhat not completely REST (e.g. you place all
your requests to one endpoint and a parameter contains the actual operation),
there are a lot of others that actually are RESTful. REST Describe now lets you
<b>choose the HTTP method</b> that should be used for the request. This is not a
big change, however an important one. Thanks to
<a href="http://yeahrock.de/">Jan Schulz-Hofen</a> for his reminder (see his
comment [Yeah] on my v0.1 release

<b>Code Generation, or what I call REST Compile</b><br />

>By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">definition</a> a
<span style="color: gray"
  ><i
    >"compiler is a computer program that translates a computer program written
    in one computer language […] into an equivalent program written in another
    computer language"</i
  ></span
>. I take this definition a little sloppy and replace the first "computer
program" by a "service description", and the "equivalent" by "implementing this
service", and even if this does not really result in an English phrase, you
probably got the idea. Once you have a WADL, implementation in a programming
language is just a localization problem. Wait a minute. Did I write
<i><b>localization problem</b></i
>? Yes, because this is basically what the code generation feature in REST
Compile is based on (thanks for the localization joke,
<a href="http://wordpress.chanezon.com/">Pat</a>). The application is created
with <a href="https://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a>, and
the toolkit's
<a
  href="https://code.google.com/webtoolkit/documentation/com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Messages.html"
  >I18N Message feature</a
>
which is based on Java property files provides us with a certain kind of
template functionality. How does this work? Let's start with an explanation of
the feature the way it was thought (i.e. for I18N):<br />
<br />
You start with a template in each language:<br />
<span style="font-family: monospace"
  ><span style="color: darkblue">runningOutOfDiskSpace</span> = Caution, you
  only have <span style="color: red">{0}</span> left.</span
><br />
<span style="font-family: monospace"
  ><span style="color: darkblue">runningOutOfDiskSpace</span> = Achtung, Sie
  haben nur noch <span style="color: red">{0}</span> übrig.</span
><br />
<br />
At runtime the program inserts the actual amount of available disk space, and
only the strings that need to be localized are kept in the property file. Now
back to the code generation idea. For instance functions or methods or whatever
you want to call them exist in almost every programming language. There are
slight differences, however, the main idea is the same. Have a look at two
equivalent functions, the first in Ruby and the second in PHP:<br />
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <br />
      <pre><br />
def welcome(name)<br />
   puts "howdy #{name}"<br />
end<br />
</pre>
    </td>
    <br />
    <td>
      <pre><br />
function welcome($name) {<br />
   echo "howdy" . $name;<br />
}<br />
</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
So "<span style="font-family: monospace">}</span>" becomes "<span
  style="font-family: monospace"
  >end</span
>", "<span style="font-family: monospace">def</span>" becomes "<span
  style="font-family: monospace"
  >function</span
>" and so on. For each language there are characteristic structures, only the
dynamic content needs to be updated. What REST Compile does is that a
<b>CodeGenerator fabric class</b> loads for example a
<b>PHP5Generator class</b> which then loads its particular
<b>Templates_PHP.properties file</b>. In consequence if you want to add another
language, simply register your generator in the CodeGenerator factory, write
your template file, add your dynamic code generating stuff to the generator, and
there you go. By the way: this <b>I18N message abuse</b> allows code generation
to happen <b>completely on the client side</b>. You could download the whole
application and run it offline.<br />

WADL is a great REST description language. You have done an awesome job,
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/mhadley/">Marc</a>! Hopefully other
developers will pick up on this release, and make WADL <i><u>the</u></i> REST
description language. Even if I would have named it

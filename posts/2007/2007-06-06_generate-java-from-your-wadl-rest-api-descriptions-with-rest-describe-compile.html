After a busy week finally one of the more important mission objectives has been accomplished: <a href="http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html">REST Describe & Compile v0.3</a> generates <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a>. Java is kind of 1990's. You need to explicitly create <i>getters and setters</i>, the strict <i>static typing</i> hinders you from simply comparing an int to null, for each optional parameter you need to create an own <i>constructor</i>, each file needs to be <i>compiled</i> before it can be tested,â€¦<br />
<br />
One of the more subtile problems are types. Internally all types are Strings (this is what goes on the POST or GET wire), however, Java adds a typed layer on top of this. This means that for the getters you need to make sure that the type is <span style="font-family:monospace;">toString()</span>-able, whereas for the setters the correct type is strictly enforced. I am pretty biased, but in my opinion strict typing is anti-web.<br />
<br />
Whatever, version 0.3 brings another fun feature. Thanks to my wonderful future wife and in response to Eduard Pelegri i Llopart's <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/page/theaquarium?anchor=more_wadl_php_ruby_and">blog entry</a> REST Describe & Describe is now also available <a href="http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html?locale=ca"><img src="https://blog.tomayac.com/flag_catalan.png" align="absmiddle" border="0" />in Catalan</a>. <a href="http://sclipo.com/controller.php?p_action=view_detail&video_id=UWC2O7G1G0">Setze jutges</a> <span style="font-family:monospace;">:-)</span><br />
<br />
You can download the <a href="http://rest-api-code-gen.googlecode.com/files/rest_describe_v0.3.zip">source code</a> from the project's Google Code site, and as always the <a href="http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html">latest version</a> is available from my web space.<br />

/><b>Firefox on Mac OS X and LiveHTTPHeaders "Alt L" Hotkey Annoyance</b><br />
<br />
On Mac OS X with German keyboard, the '@' character is accessible via "Alt L".
However, if you use Firefox and you have the
<a href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">LiveHTTPHeaders</a> extension
installed, "Alt L" will fire up the extension in the sidebar rather than
printing '@'.<br />
<br />
You can overcome this annoyance by disabling or remapping the hotkey for
LiveHTTPHeaders. This can be easily done with the
<a href="http://mozilla.dorando.at/keyconfig.xpi">KeyConfig</a> extension.
LiveHTTPHeaders author Daniel Savard has promised to make the hotkey
configurable in the 1.0 release. In between, the suggested solution is a good
workaroundâ€¦<br />

<b>HOWTO make a screencast on Mac OS X</b><br />
<br />
The last three days I have made
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tomayac">three screencasts</a>, and with
this blog entry I would like to share my experiences in a HOWTO style. A
<b>screencast</b> is like a <i>guided tour through a software program</i>. Its
main goal is to give a quick overview of what the software can do, and
occasionally also of what it cannot do.<br />
<br />
<b>Workflow</b><br />
<br />
I work on a MacBook. Most of the things I have learnt about screencasting on Mac
OS X, I have learnt from
<a
  href="http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/articles/2007/01/31/how-to-make-a-screencast-on-mac-os-x/"
  >Jesse Newland's blog entry</a
>
on screencasting (thank you, this is an awesome introduction).<br />
<br />
<b>Jesse</b> basically describes the following workflow:
<ol>
  <li>
    Think of what you want to show, and write a <b>script</b> of what you want
    to say.
  </li>
  <li>Remember the script and <b>learn it by heart</b>.</li>
  <li>Learn how to <b>enunciate</b>.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Record the screencast and recite your script</b> as often until it is
    perfect.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Publish</b> the screencast to your web space and <b>blog</b> about it.
  </li>
</ol>
While this might sound like a good plan to you, for me it is not appropriate in
one point: <i>learn the script by heart</i>. Already back in school I failed
awefully at learning poems by heart. <br />
<br />
In consequence, <b>I</b> suggest the following workflow:
<ol>
  <li>Think of what you want to <b>show</b>.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Record the screencast without sound</b> as often until it is perfect
    (usually you will succeed after two or three runs, as you can fully
    concentrate on the screen).
  </li>
  <li>For each scene think of what you want to <b>say</b>.</li>
  <li>
    Loop over each scene and <b>record the audio separately</b> until it is
    perfect (usually you will be done after many, many runs, as you probably
    will notice that in the beginning your enunciation on recorded voice, well,
    sucks).
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine sound and video to a complete screencast and publish it to your
    <b>blog</b>, <u>and</u> to <b>YouTube</b> (or any other video sharing
    platform). This allows others to easily <b>embed your screencast</b> in
    their own blogs, but in contrast also allows users to <b>download</b> the
    full quality files.
  </li>
</ol>
<br />
<b>Required software</b><br />
<br />
As mentioned before, I work on a Mac, so this list covers Mac OS X software:<img

  width="120"
  hspace="5"
/>
<ul>
  <li>
    For <b>video recording</b> my colleague
    <a href="http://wordpress.chanezon.com/">Patrick Chanezon</a> pointed me to
    <a href="http://www.shinywhitebox.com/home/home.html">iShowU</a> ($20), a
    software that is amazingly intuitive, and perfectly appropriate for
    screencasting. It also ships with default settings that you rarely ever need
    to touch.
  </li>
  <li>
    For <b>highlighting the mouse cursor</b>, I used
    <a href="http://boinx.com/mousepose/">Mouseposé 2</a> ($14.95) from Boinx
    Software. It puts like a spotlight effect around your mouse cursor, and also
    displays your mouse clicks visually. In addition to that, it can highlight
    your key strokes. I did not activate this feature, though.
  </li>
  <li>
    In some ways Mac OS X is a real cripple, there just is no
    <b>sound recorder</b>, however, I had good experience with
    <a href="http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/SoundRecorder.shtml"
      >Monkeybread's Sound Recorder</a
    >
    (freeware), a totally foolproof piece of software that just does what you
    expect from a simple sound recorder.
  </li>
  <li>
    For <b>video editing</b> I used Mac OS X's own
    <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie</a> (shipped with Mac OS
    X), a simple, however still mighty (for my needs) video editing software. It
    has transitions, supports still frame extraction, allows for basic clip
    editing etc., short, it is simple enough to be learnt in about one hour,
    without lacking really essential features.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once your screencast looks and sounds good to you, you can <b>export</b> it
    from iMovie as a
    <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/">Quicktime</a> movie (shipped with
    Mac OS X). I think that Quicktime is a pain in the butt on other platforms
    than Mac because it is huge, and because it claws itself into your systems
    like a tick bite (on a Mac you cannot get rid of it either, but because it
    is Mac, people do not hate it, like they hate for example Window Media
    Player [note my subtle Mac criticism]). That is why I also encourage you to
    post to YouTube, there it is just Flash which is relatively light-weight and
    universally available.
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Technical encoding details</b><br />
<br />
I published the videos in full quality, and in a lower resolution for people
that hate huge files. I used:
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Resolution:</b> native (720x480), and 320x240 for YouTube and low
    resolution
  </li>
  <li><b>Multipass processing:</b> enabled</li>
  <li><b>Codec:</b> H.264</li>
  <li><b>Audio: </b>44,1 kHz, 16-bit, Stereo</li>
</ul>
In addition to that, the YouTube folks give

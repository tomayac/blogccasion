/><b>Dog food in REST Compile & Describe</b><br />
<br />
A lot of companies, including the <a href="https://www.google.com/">one</a> I
work for, are eating their own
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one%27s_own_dog_food">dog food</a> as
a means of improving the overall quality of their products. I am planning to
follow this pattern in
<a href="http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html"
  >REST Describe & Compile</a
>, that is to say in the Grammars and Namespace Discoverer modules. I am
thinking of a module that uses code created by REST Compile, and then executes
this code in order to retrieve the namespaces and particular XML schemas a
certain web service uses. So the process flow would be:
<ol>
  <li>Analyze a request URI and generate a first <b>reqest-based WADL</b></li>
  <li>Use this WADL file to <b>generate request code</b></li>
  <li>
    <b>Execute the generated code</b> on the server, i.e. place a real API
    request
  </li>
  <li>
    Harvest the returned response and
    <b>discover the contained namespaces and XML schemas</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    Refine the previously generated WADL, and
    <b>add the response-based WADL information</b>
  </li>
  <li>Return the <b>final version of the WADL</b></li>
  <li>
    Return the <b>final version of the code</b> with proper response handling
  </li>
</ol>
This raises the question about <i>security</i>. Is executing code on your server
a good idea? How can evil requests be detected? Can someone create a request
that transforms into WADL that then in turn transforms into code that harms your
server? What do you think?<br />

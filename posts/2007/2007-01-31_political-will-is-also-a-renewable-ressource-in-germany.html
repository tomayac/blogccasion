<b>Political will is also a renewable resource in Germany</b><br />
<br />
I do not want such a leader for my country:

<br />
<b>Dear German car industry,</b><br />
<br />
Where is the car
<ul>
  <li>
    …that has no power windows <span style="color: gray">[weight-saving]</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    …that has no centralized door locking
    <span style="color: gray">[weight-saving]</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    …that has no always-on air condition
    <span style="color: gray">[fuel-saving]</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    …that is hybrid-powered <span style="color: gray">[fuel-efficient]</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    …that comes with no useless electronic gadgets
    <span style="color: gray">[on-board engery-efficient]</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    …that is available in a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 person edition
    <span style="color: gray">[reduce to the max]</span>
  </li>
</ul>
Probably one day, once you have implemented at least some of these suggestions,
you will see that this also creates jobs. Because people will no longer have to
buy Hondas and Toyotas in order to get at least environmental-positive cars.<br />
However, as long as you act like that, and as long as our government supports
this backwards politics, be sure that I will not buy one of your cars.<br />
<br />
"Best" regards,<br />

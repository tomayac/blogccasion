<b>Parts of Barcelona still without power</b><br />
<br />
Another groundhog day. It is 1:49pm, I have been for more than 48 hours without
power, my fridge is an advance warning of what global warming will cause if we
do not stop it, and the local public library is playing the "we are closing for
dinner" jingle. Feels like one of those parties where the DJ at the end gets out
the music your parent's parents used to listen toâ€¦ They are switching the lights
off now. Guess it is time to leave. I have charged my laptop batteries, the
power should last for the lunch break. It is not awesome depending on opening
hours of libraries for getting work done.

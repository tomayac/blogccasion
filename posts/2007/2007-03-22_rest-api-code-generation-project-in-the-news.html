<b>REST API Code Generation project in the news…</b><br />
<br />
This morning when I started my work day by reading the news in Google Reader, I noticed that my project announced <a href="/index.php?date=2007-03-12&time=17:11:27&perma=Automatic+Multi+Lang.html">earlier </a> had gotten some attention:<ul><li><a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/03/WADL">InfoQ</a> came up with the initial story which was later picked up by</li><li>the folks from <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2007/03/22/wadl-and-google-rest-compile/">Programmable Web</a></li></ul>It seems to be common practice among the description language architects to start with a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/news/V1/newsSearch.html">Yahoo News Search API</a> description, so I justed sticked to this tradition. Below is a very early screenshot of REST Describe running in Firefox. You can see the screenshot in a fullscreen view by clicking on it:<br />

If you are interested in the project, please see the <a href="/index.php?date=2007-03-12&time=17:11:27&perma=Automatic+Multi+Lang.html">earlier </a> blog post for the related links. Thank you.<br />

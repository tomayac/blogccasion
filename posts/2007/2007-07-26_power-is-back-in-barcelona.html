<b>Power is back in Barcelona</b><br />

Since yesterday, 11:00 at night, power is completely back in Barcelona. For us,
Laura and me, the power outage took exactly 60 hours. During my daily walks to
the library, I saw power slowly coming back from day to day, more and more
houses had light each time the library forced me to have a lunch break. Our
house remained stubbornly dark though. Yesterday I celebrated the
<b>national yoghurt commemoration day</b> and ate like eight yoghurts that had
survived the fridge hell.<br />
<br />
The most fun part was yesterday evening. The Spanish have this old tradition of
expressing dissatisfaction with the government by
<b>hammering on pots, pans, or whatever makes a reasonable amount of noise</b>.
Laura and me were having a forced - however romantic - candlelight dinner, when
at about 9:30pm people started making noise. We went out on the balcony and
joined the party. Suddenly, as if the
<a href="https://www.endesaclientes.com/login.html">Endesa folks</a> had heard
our protest, power came back. But not to our house. It was like surrealistic.
Across the street we could see people starting to watch TV, and turning their
lights and vacuum cleaners back on, but we, and three or four other houses in
Carrer Verdi, were still sitting in the dark. People on the balconies started
shouting "Falta una casa!" (One house is missing!) expressing their solidarity
with us, but power did not reach us.<br />
<br />
We went to bed early with candlelight and were getting ready for the third night
without electricity, however way more romance, and when the night just started
to get interesting, all of a sudden power came back to our house. I got up,
switched the few lights off that now had gone on, and continued a fantastic
night in the dark.

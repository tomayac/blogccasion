Recently there is a lot of discussion about the XML vs. JSON question. Of
course, JSON is easier for dealing with it directly from within a Javascript
context. And yes, maybe it is less verbose than XML. But in the end, in my very
own opinion, this is not really what it is all about. Kind of like the big
endian / little endian question. It is just a different approach for solving the
same category of problems.<br />

You are at A, the service you are interested in is at B. So you send your query
using HTTP GET or POST and wait for the response. Then you work either with an
XML data structure or with a JSON data structure. Practically, they are almost
always Turing-equivalent. To me as a developer it is way more important to have
a <i>forgiving</i> API, an API that is based on the idea of
<i>agreeing to principles</i>. Something like: this is a number (no matter if
Integer, Long, Float, or Real). APIs are very likely to change over time. The
less strong your typing, the less code you will break. The real challenge is
bringing together <i>sloppy</i> web services (IMHO rather "good") and strict
programming languages (IMHO rather "bad") like C# or Java. In the forthcoming
months I will see

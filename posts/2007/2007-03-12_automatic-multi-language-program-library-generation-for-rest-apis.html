<b>1) Automatic Multi Language Program Library Generation for REST APIs</b
><br />
<br />
Since February 2007 I have started working on my Final Year Project whose
(working) title is
<i>"Automatic Multi Language Program Library Generation for REST APIs"</i>. This
project was suggested by
<a href="http://wordpress.chanezon.com/">Patrick Chanezon</a>, Checkout API
Evangelist with Google Inc. The project's main goal is to create a compiler
which allows for automatic client code generation in various programming
languages. This should be based on a meta description of a RESTful web service.
After a first "market" survey of the available description languages, and having
been in touch with Marc (thanks again), my choice for the meta description
language will probably be
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/mhadley/">Marc Hadley's</a> approach named
<a href="https://wadl.dev.java.net/">WADL</a>. The diagram below tries to
illustrate the idea:

<br />
<b>2) Rich web application for WADL file creation</b><br />
<br />
In my opinion RESTful web services are in broad use because of their simplicity
for human beings. However, writing a (WADL) description for already existing web
services can be a rather annoying manual job. The project's second goal is thus
to implement a rich web application which allows for more or less interactive
WADL creation based on "copied and pasted" example code which is usually
available in textual form in the human-readable docs of the web service. Below
the correspondent diagram:
<div style="background-color: white">
  <img src="/images/Google_REST_Describe.png" alt="REST Describe" />
</div>
This is very much work in progress, i.e. there are no concrete results yet.
However, for all those interested in the process, there are two main, and one
minor resources you can have a look at every now and then:
<ul>
  <li>

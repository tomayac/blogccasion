<b>REST Describe first working Beta released</b><br />
<br />
Today I have released version 0.1 of REST Describe (described in an
<a
  href="/index.php?date=2007-03-12&time=17:11:27&perma=Automatic+Multi+Lang.html"
  >earlier blog post</a
>). The application is based on the idea that creating a description for a Web
Service should be a rather simple task given the information already contained
in requests. Let's take a very simple imaginary online bookmarking Web Service
to make the idea clear:<br />
<br />
<code
  ><span style="color: darkblue">GET http://bookmarks-online.com</span
  ><span style="color: blue">/api/v1/</span
  ><span style="color: rgb(192, 0, 255)">bookmarks</span
  ><span style="color: red">?userId</span>=<span style="color: darkgreen"
    >tom</span
  >&<span style="color: red">tags</span>=<span style="color: darkgreen"
    >rest</span
  >&<span style="color: red">limit</span>=<span style="color: darkgreen"
    >10</span
  ></code
><br />
<br />
Simply by looking at the URI we can extract the following information:
<ul>
  <li>
    <code><span style="color: darkblue">http://bookmarks-online.com</span></code
    >: there is a Web Service at this base address.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code><span style="color: blue">/api/v1/</span></code
    >: this is the path to access the service components.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code><span style="color: rgb(192, 0, 255)">bookmarks</span></code
    >: there is an operation that manages your bookmarks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code
      ><span style="color: red">?userId</span>=<span style="color: darkgreen"
        >tom</span
      >&<span style="color: red">tags</span>=<span style="color: darkgreen"
        >rest</span
      >&<span style="color: red">limit</span>=<span style="color: darkgreen"
        >10</span
      ></code
    >: it takes three arguments, "userId", "tags", and "limit". When we have a
    closer look, we could guess that "userId" and "tags" are both strings, and
    that "limit" is an integer value.
  </li>
</ul>
And all this information just from one example request. This is basically what
the REST Describe approach is based on. It takes an (ideally complete) list of
URIs, <b>analyzes the structure</b>, does some <b>type estimations</b>, and
afterwards creates an <b>XML representation</b> of the request.
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/mhadley/">Marc Hadley</a> has done a great
job in defining <a href="https://wadl.dev.java.net/">WADL</a>, the XML-based Web
Service description language REST Describe supports.<br />

      width="300"
  /></a>
</center>
<br />
However, the approach described above has some shortcomings:
<ul>
  <li>
    Custom types cannot be guessed (e.g. searchOptions = {all | phrase | any}).
    In a sample request there would be just a parameter value "phrase" for
    example. To any analyzer this looks perfectly like a string, there is no way
    to find out that the only valid values are "all", "phrase", and "any". That
    is why REST Describe allows for <b>custom type definition</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeating or required parameters cannot be determined. The pure presence of
    a certain parameter does not automatically imply that this parameter is
    necessary or not. Thus REST Describe allows for
    <b>completely interactive WADL editing</b>. You can create, remove, or
    modify almost everything directly in the WADL tree.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type estimation is a sometimes tricky job. Imagine we have a parameter value
    of "1". This might be an integer value, however, very often this is also
    used as a boolean value. What REST Describe does is to analyze the parameter
    name and the parameter value as well. How does this work in real life? It is
    common programming practice to prefix boolean parameters with "is", for
    example "isActive". This is a first clue that "1" might be a boolean in a
    parameter "isActivated=1", and a string in "results=1". Adjectives terminate
    very often with "ed", so a parameter "enabled=1" might be a boolean, too.
    This kind of type analysis allows REST Describe to give the user an idea of
    how exact the type analysis is.<br />

  </li>
</ul>
<br />
REST Describe is developed with the
<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a>. During
development I very often hit the limit of available event management memory and
after a few test runs had to restart the hosted Google Web Toolkit Browser.
However, besides this annoyance, the toolkit is a real pleasure to use. It
allows for completely Java-fied web application development. There are some
problems with Trees in ScrollPanels, I hope that with the next release of the
toolkit these issues will be resolved.<br />

<u>Update:</u> In order to avoid any confusion I have changed the name of the
project, basically I have removed the "Google" from it. <i>Yes</i>, I do work
for and get paid by Google for developing this project, but <i>no</i>, the
project is <b>not an official Google product</b>. Period.<br />

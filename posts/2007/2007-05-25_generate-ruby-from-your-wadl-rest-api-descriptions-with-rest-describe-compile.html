  >Generate Ruby from your WADL REST API Descriptions with REST Describe &
  Compile</b
><br />
<br />
I have been digging a bit into
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> today, and I must say that probably
I will not really make friends with this hip language. Honestly, is it necessary
to do stuff like this:
<pre><br />
puts "1, 2, " + 3.to_s<br />
</pre>
<img src="/images/REST_Describe_Logo.png" alt="REST Describe logo" style="float: left" hspace="20" />Mind
the little
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Fixnum.html#M001069"
  ><span style="font-family: monospace">to_s</span></a
>
that has to convert the
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Fixnum.html">Fixnum</a> into a
String before printing. I know, everything is an object, but come on, a
scripting language should be somewhat more forgiving. At least this is what I
think.<br />
<br />
<img
  src="/images/REST_Compile_Logo.png"
  style="float: left"
  hspace="20"
/>Anyway, the latest
<a href="http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html"
  >version 0.2.1 of REST Describe & Compile</a
>
comes with Ruby support. As you can see from the introduction, I am not much a
Ruby guy (yet), so any suggestions to improve the quality of the auto-generated
code are highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
You can download the
<a href="http://rest-api-code-gen.googlecode.com/files/rest_describe_v0.2.1.zip"
  >source code</a
>
under a BSD license, and as always the
<a href="http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html"
  >latest version</a
>
is available directly from my web space. Auch auf
<a href="http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html?locale=de"
  >deutsch</a
>. You can access older versions by hacking the URL:
<span style="font-family: monospace"
  >http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/<span style="color: red">0.X.Y</span
  >/RestDescribe.html</span
>, where X and Y stand for the old version numbers.

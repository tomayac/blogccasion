<b>REST Describe and why WADL is so god damn German</b><br />
<br />
These days I am dealing a lot with the
<a href="https://wadl.dev.java.net/wadl20061109.pdf">WADL spec</a> (PDF). WADL
is one of the mightiest Web Service description languages out there. With the
<a
  href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/03/gdata-for-picasa-web-albums.html"
  >announcement</a
>
of the release of the new
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/picasaweb/overview.html">GData API</a> for
Picasa Web Albums, the language's potential to describe features that are not
known until run time will be put to the utmost. Imagine you want to describe a
request like this:<br />
<br />
<code
  >http://picasaweb.google.com/data/feed/projection/user/userID/albumid/albumID/photoid/photoID?kind=kinds</code
>
<br />
<br />
There are a whole bunch of unknown path variables inside of the request URI:
<ul>
  <li>userID</li>
  <li>albumID</li>
  <li>photoID</li>
</ul>
WADL is capable of describing this structure(!).<br />
<br />
Anyway, on my way to doing this in an automated way, I moved another small step
forward today. Have a look at the screenshot below: now there is one of these
fancy in-application windows. This allows for different parameters to be tested
directly from within REST Describe which can then be accepted for further
analysis. What does the app do so far?
<ol>
  <li>
    It <b>resolves the URI</b> and extracts
    <ul>
      <li>the endpoint</li>
      <li>the request name</li>
      <li>the request parameters</li>
      <li>the fragment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    It then analysis the request parameters and does
    <b>basic type guessing</b> based on regular expressions
  </li>
  <li>
    TODO: It then builds an <b>XML document tree</b> that will be the basis for
    the final WADL document
  </li>
</ol>

So finally back to the confusing header: "Why WADL is so god damn German". You
guys probably know this clich√© of the typical German with leather pants and
beer. In the bavarian dialect a "Wadl" is the calf, the lower part of your leg.
Do an image search in order to see what
<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=%22stramme+wadln%22"
  >"Stramme Wadln"</a
>
is. And no, neither do I look like that, nor do I come from Bavaria. <br />

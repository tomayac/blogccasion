<b>REST Describe in the news and Road Map</b><br />

<a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/google-rest-describe-wadl-toolkit"
  >blogged</a

about yesterday's Beta release of
<a href="http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html"
  >REST Describe</a
>. Now I am looking forward to receiving some sort of feedback, and hopefully
some more WADL files for existing REST Web Services. In addition to that, a
short Road Map of what I am planning for the next release:<br />
<br />
Plans for the v0.2 release:
<ul>
  <li>
    Add a <b>Grammar and Includes Discoverer</b> server-side component that
    parses the output of a request in order to find the contained grammars and
    includes. Because of the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy"
      >same origin policy</a
    >
    limitation of today's Ajax implementations in browser this has to be proxied
    on the server.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the possibility to <b>upload WADL files</b>, parse them, and have them
    displayed nicely in the WADL tree in order to make modifications to the
    file. This will be either a simple textarea where you can paste the WADL
    file, or (probably later because of security concerns) a server-side upload.
  </li>
</ul>
Plans for later releases:
<ul>
  <li>Let users <b>save their WADLs</b> on the server.</li>
  <li>
    Add the possibility to <b>create code from WADLs</b> (I call this feature
    <i>REST Compile</i>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Have some <b>spider extract links from API documentation</b> for easier
    batch URI analysis. I am pretty sure that something like this has been
    implemented before.
  </li>
</ul>
Thanks <a href="http://wordpress.chanezon.com">Patrick</a> and
<a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/about">John</a> for your ideas so far.
Again, due to the relatively broad coverage this project has gained, I would
like to point to the fact that this is
<i>not an official Google product</i>.<br />

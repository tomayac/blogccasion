<b>Disabling Blog Comments</b><br />
<br />
I have given up. The (barely never) used commenting function of my blog got
repeatedly spammed. In consequence, I have removed it from my home-brew blog
software. It was fun while it lasted. Looking back, I had added a simple
<a
  href="/index.php?date=2005-12-27&time=12:08:43&perma=Blog-Spam+On+My+blog.html"
  >Turing test</a
>
back in 2005, but apparently the spammers have caught up and care enough to even
spam my super low traffic blog. If you're a spammer and you read this:
<strong>you win</strong>. Also, fuck you!<br />
<br />
If you care enough to comment on any of the items on this blog, you know how to
reach me: <a href="http://twitter.com/tomayac">@tomayac</a> or
<a href="http://tomayac.com/+">+tomayac</a>.

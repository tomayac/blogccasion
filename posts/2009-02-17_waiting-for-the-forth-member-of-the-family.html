<b>Waiting for the forth member of the family</b><br />

The baby is due on March 1, however, the doctor said it could easily be born one or two weeks earlier. Today is February 17, we can hardly stand waiting any longer and just keep speculating about the date to keep ourselves entertained during the long evenings. The cradle is ready, the musical pull-down stuffed frog is bought, Laura knitted a warm green blanket, socks, shoes (one for the moment), and a bonnet, all that is missing is the baby. It'll be a girl, I am pretty sure. As I was last time. When we play music for <i>her</i>, she moves and dances, and we can see her little feet bulge Laura's belly. So looking forward to holding her in my arms... <br />

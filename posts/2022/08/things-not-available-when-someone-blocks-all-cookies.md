The other day, I received a harmless-looking [Issue](https://github.com/tomayac/SVGcode/issues/86) for my app [SVGcode](https://svgco.de/)
([announcement blog post](/2021/11/22/releasing-svgcode/index.html)). The Issue read:

> **Crash when opened with cookies blocked**
>
> Hey
> I block cookies by default. Unfortunately your website doesn‚Äôt handle that nicely despite it not needing (IMO) cookies to operate.
> I'm getting this error, because blocking cookies also blocks localStorage.
>
> `Uncaught DOMException: Failed to read the 'localStorage' property from 'Window': Access is denied for this document.`
> Please add fallback to js provided localStorage, because it makes the app unusable.

I don't use cookies in the app at all, but for sure, when I disabled cookies in Chrome, the app wasn't usable.

All I _am_ using is some innocent `localStorage` and IndexedDB to persist user settings like the values of the sliders or the chosen color scheme.

Turns out, with all cookies blocked, Chrome disables a lot of (all?) APIs that can be used to persist data and thus potentially profile users. Here are the ones that I found:

- [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
- [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
- [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
- [CacheStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage)
- [Web SQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) (obsolete)
- [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)
- [Origin Private File System](https://web.dev/file-system-access/#accessing-the-origin-private-file-system)
- [`webkitRequestFileSystem()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestFileSystem) (obsolete)

The code sample below shows all these APIs and the error messages they throw when you try to use them with cookies blocked.

```js
localStorage
// Uncaught DOMException: Failed to read the 'localStorage' property from Window: Access is denied for this document.

sessionStorage
// Uncaught DOMException: Failed to read the 'sessionStorage' property from 'Window: Access is denied for this document.

await caches.open ('test')
// Uncaught DOMException: An attempt was made to break through the security policy of the user agent.

const openRequest = indexedDB. open ("test", 1);
openRequest.onerror = function () {
  console.error(openRequest.error);
}
// DOMException: The user denied permission to access the database.

openDatabase('test', '1', 'test', 1)
// Uncaught DOMException: An attempt was made to break through the security policy of the user agent.

await navigator.serviceWorker.register('.')
// Uncaught DOMException: Failed to register a ServiceWorker for scope ('https://example.com/') with script ('https://example.com/'): The user denied permission to use Service Worker.

await navigator.storage.getDirectory()
// Uncaught DOMException: Storage directory access is denied.

webkitRequestFileSystem(window.PERSISTENT, 1, () => {}, (err) => console.error(err))
// DOMException: An ongoing operation was aborted, typically with a call to abort().

webkitRequestFileSystem(window.TEMPORARY, 1, () => {}, (err) => console.error(err))
// DOMException: An ongoing operation was aborted, typically with a call to abort().
```

Did I miss anything?

The fix for the Issue was annoying, but simple. Always [`try...catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) any potentially blocked calls:

Please [report](https://github.com/tomayac/SVGcode/issues/) any other errors you encounter (I don't care for the analytics script failing). And thanks, [@JakubekWeg](https://github.com/JakubekWeg) for caring enough to having opened this Issue!

On a tangent, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is completely broken with cookies blocked, too. I was about to report this problem (because I care and love MDN üòç),
when I discovered a [PR](https://github.com/mdn/yari/pull/6352) is already under way that fixes the [Issue](https://github.com/mdn/yari/issues/6758). Thanks, [@bershanskiy](https://github.com/bershanskiy)!

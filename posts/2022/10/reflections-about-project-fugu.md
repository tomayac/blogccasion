I had the honor of being asked to contribute some lines to
[Jorge del Casar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgecasar/)'s newsletter called
[Estandarte](http://newsletter.jorgecasar.com/). As you may guess from the name,
the newsletter is written in Spanish, so I wrote
[my contribution](http://newsletter.jorgecasar.com/issues/estandarte-publicacion-11-1266274#:~:text=En%20los%20primeros,fugu%2Dshowcase/.)
in said language (which Jorge thankfully brushed up a little). Find the English
translation below.

In the early days of [Project Fugu](https://developer.chrome.com/capabilities/),
we talked a lot about "closing the app gap". We wanted to put Web developers in
a position where they could implement anything on the Web that they could
implement for platforms like Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, etc. We still want
that, but we have changed our thinking a bit: instead of working down a list of
APIs, we're now looking at what use cases this has enabled. Don't get me wrong,
working down this list was essential, but it left developers a bit in the dark
as to our actual motivation and priorities. To the external observer, some of
what we released may have seemed a bit random. The opposite is the case: from
the start we were partner-driven. Where things fell a bit short was that we
failed to fully convey our vision to developers what this was all about:
enabling Microsoft to release [Visual Studio Code](https://vscode.dev/), Adobe
to launch [Photoshop](https://photoshop.adobe.com/), BandLab Technologies to
create [BandLab](https://www.bandlab.com/), and many projects big and small
more.

Now with the initial batch of APIs done, our focus has shifted on refining and
improving these APIs. Make them more ergonomic to use, be more
privacy-preserving, and more complete in addressing the needs of developers. Be
sure to read my recent article
[Is Project Fugu done?](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/is-project-fugu-done/),
where I go in more detail regarding our thinking there. My
[Twitter DMs](https://twitter.com/messages) and [email](mailto:tomac@google.com)
are always open and I love hearing developer stories and feature your apps on
the
[üê° Project Fugu API Showcase](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/fugu-showcase/).

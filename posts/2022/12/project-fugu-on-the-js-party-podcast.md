I had the honor of being interviewed on the
[JS Party podcast](https://changelog.com/jsparty) and chat about Project Fugu
🐡. Thanks to the hosts, [Amal Hussein](https://twitter.com/nomadtechie) and
[Nick Nisi](https://t.co/DZ4ioWAWMX), for the interesting questions. Here's the
episode for your listening pleasure.

One of the most frequent questions we hear on the Project Fugu team is: ü§î _"What are some of the apps people build with Project Fugu üê° APIs?"_

The [Project Fugu API Showcase](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/fugu-showcase/) is our answer:

It allows interested parties to get a filterable list of all the apps, big and small, that use a given API.

Need to prove that we're building obscure-sounding APIs like the [Web Serial API](https://web.dev/serial/) for a reason? Select the API's chip and there goes a list of all the apps that use it:

The [Project Fugu API Showcase](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/fugu-showcase/) is community-driven. Everyone can [submit apps for inclusion](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNd1rClbmFWh6FcMmjUNrwg9RLz8Jk4BkHz_-EOpmkVd_-9g/viewform), and they will get listed after a short period of time of verification and approval.

Of course the Project Fugu API Showcase is contained in itself (yay, recursion üéâ), which means on supporting browsers you can use it to share it (or any other of the contained apps) with your followers:

Please help spread the word and use this in discussions with the people you work with (whose apps you‚Äîor they‚Äîare obviously most welcome to add to the showcase):

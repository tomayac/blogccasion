If you want to build an app, you have several ways of doing it. You can build a
platform-specific app for the platforms you care about, for example, Windows,
Android, and iOS. In which case you would build three apps. You can also build a
(progressive) web app, possibly _in addition to_ platform-specific apps.
Alternatively, you can choose a cross-platform framework such as
[Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) or
[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) that promises to let you write once and run
anywhere. Let me begin by walking you through three extraordinary examples of
apps whose makers chose to _also_ build for the web, apart from building
platform-specific apps.

## Beacon cases that demonstrate the web's abilities

### Photoshop

I always saw Photoshop as one of the last bastions of high quality apps that
supposedly would never make it to the web platform. Forget that—this last
bastion has finally fallen. With [Photoshop](https://web.dev/ps-on-the-web/),
Adobe, together with Chromium engineering, has managed to get a beta version of
Photoshop running in the browser that can serve as the new beacon showcase of
what is possible on the web. In it, you can try out the commenting workflow and
test some early Photoshop editing features Adobe is piloting on the web. You and
your collaborators can now open and view Photoshop cloud documents in the
browser, provide feedback, and make basic edits. All in one place without having
to download or launch the app.

### Visual Studio Code

Similarly, Microsoft has launched
[Visual Studio Code on the web](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/20/vscode-dev),
a fully fledged, installable web experience of its integrated development
environment (IDE) that makes developing completely in the browser possible,
including the option to open and edit files on the local file system.

### Twitter

Lastly Twitter—whose progressive web app (PWA) is
[largely seen](https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/social/150171/twitter-lite-now-adapts-larger-screens#:~:text=probably%20the%20best%20mainstream%20progressive%20web%20app)
as _probably the best mainstream progressive web app_—has
[used](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2019/twitter-for-mac-is-coming-back#:~:text=This%20led%20to%20our%20Responsive%20Web%20codebase%20being%20the%20spearhead%20for%20all%20platforms%20via%20web%20browsers)
its responsive web codebase for all platforms, mobile and desktop, via web
browsers. On Windows, the PWA is the experience the company is confident enough
to make _the_ Twitter experience that you get when you
[install](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows)
the app from the Microsoft Store.

## Linkability and universality: the web's super powers

All three companies, Adobe, Microsoft, and Twitter, in parallel with their web
apps, have well-established, platform-specific Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and
Linux versions of their apps Photoshop, Visual Studio Code, and Twitter
respectively. So why did they build for the web on top? The answer lies in its
linkability and universality.

As Google's Thomas Nattestad
[put it](https://web.dev/ps-on-the-web/#:~:text=the%20simple%20power%20of%20a%20url%20is%20that%20anyone%20can%20click%20it%20and%20instantly%20access%20it.%20all%20you%20need%20is%20a%20browser.%20there%20is%20no%20need%20to%20install%20an%20application%20or%20worry%20about%20what%20operating%20system%20you%20are%20running%20on.):
_"The simple power of a URL is that anyone can click it and instantly access it.
All you need is a browser. There is no need to install an application or worry
about what operating system you are running on"_.
[According to](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/20/vscode-dev#:~:text=You%20can%20make%20quick%20edits%2C%20review%20PRs%2C%20and%20Continue%20on%20to%20a%20local%20clone)
Microsoft's [Chris Dias](https://twitter.com/chrisdias), with Visual Studio Code
for the Web, when working with GitHub _"you can make quick edits, review PRs,
and continue on to a local clone"_. The sole fact that you can share a link to
your work unlocks collaboration patterns that users have embraced and loved
since the birth of apps such as Google Docs. Twitter, of course, lives and dies
by its links. News sites regularly
[link to newsworthy tweets](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/09/politics/gosar-anime-video-violence-ocasio-cortez-biden/index.html#:~:text=Ocasio-Cortez%20tweeted%20in%20response%20Monday%20saying%20a%20%22creepy%20member%22%20of%20the%20House%20had%20%22shared%20a%20fantasy%20video%20of%20him%20killing%20me.%22),
which _means "keeping it quick"_
[is core](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2019/progressively-enhancing-desktop-devices#:~:text=%C2%A0-,Keeping%20it%20quick,-With%20all%20the)
to ensuring people can get from an article straight into the app, where they can
read or engage with the linked tweet.

Web applications are inherently universal. They run on whatever operating system
is capable of running a web browser and they do not need to be compiled for each
operating system separately. The same code base powers the application on all
platforms. This does not mean that there are no compatibility issues—there are
plenty actually—but there is a
[solid, shared, increasing baseline](https://web.dev/interop-2022/) that all
applications can build upon.

### Linkability of platform-specific apps

While more ubiquitous on mobile, linking into a platform-specific app from the
web on desktop is comparatively rare. On mobile (and macOS), this works via a
technology called
[Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/) on iOS (and
on macOS), and [App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/) on
Android. Platform-specific apps alternatively can rely on
[registered protocol schemes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app)
such as `itms-apps:` for when you want to deep-link into the App Store app on
macOS or iOS, or register your own custom schemes for your own apps. So while
technically possible, linking into platform-specific apps is a lot less flexible
and requires more plumbing work than simply linking into a web app.

## The slow decline of interest in cross-platform app frameworks and the rise of Flutter

The web isn't the only platform that promises _"write once, run anywhere"_.
Cross-platform frameworks _à la_ Electron.js do, too. With the web becoming
powerful enough to drive apps such as Photoshop that were thought to be
impossible, we can, however, observe a slow decline of interest in
cross-platform desktop app frameworks such as
[Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/), and
mobile app frameworks such as [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) or
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/); while at the same time there is an
undeniable increase of interest in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

### Google Trends stats

The following
[Google Trends chart](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1636457400?hl=en-US&tz=-60&cat=5&date=today+5-y&q=%2Fg%2F11bw_559wr,%2Fg%2F11f11js9bh,%2Fm%2F06znsr5,%2Fg%2F11f03_rzbg,%2Fg%2F11h03gfxy9&sni=3)
shows the five frameworks side by side. While noting that this chart _does_ show
disambiguated topic trends as detected by Google (as opposed to ambiguous
[search term trends](/2021/11/08/things-mode-and-strings-mode-in-google-trends/)),
nevertheless it is clearly _not_ an exact science.

## Shouldn't everybody be building for the web, then?

Given the examples of Photoshop, VS Code, and Twitter, that show that it is
indeed possible to build amazing applications on the web, and given the web's
super powers of linkability and universality, two research questions come up:

- <span id="research-question-1">Research question ①:</span>
  [Why do people not fully bet on PWA?](#why-do-people-not-fully-bet-on-pwa)
- <span id="research-question-2">Research question ②:</span>
  [Why is Flutter so popular?](#why-is-flutter-so-popular)

### Why do people not fully bet on PWA?

For [research question ①](#research-question-1), the answer is complex and
manyfold. I want to break it down into different sub-categories.

#### Missing capabilities: aka the app gap

Web applications still lack certain functionalities that platform-specific apps
have. In the following paragraph, I list representative examples of such
functionalities on different platforms.

First, it is impossible, even with an installed PWA, to obey the macOS user
interface paradigm of having the
[app menu at the top of the screen](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/menus/menu-bar-menus/).
It can easily be achieved with frameworks such as Electron.js via the
<code>[Menu](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/menu)</code> class. (On
the web, the next best thing is
[Window Controls Overlay](https://web.dev/window-controls-overlay/); getting
support for app menus is tracked as [crbug/1295253](https://crbug.com/1295253).)
Another example is in-app purchases on macOS that can be handled via Electron's
<code>[inAppPurchase()](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/in-app-purchases)</code>
method. (On the web, the next best thing is the
[Digital Goods API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity/receive-payments-play-billing/),
currently limited to Android and ChromeOS.) Installers are a common way users
have learned to install applications on Windows. With Electron.js, it is
possible to create
[installers](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/auto-updater#windows)
and make installed applications
[update automatically](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/auto-updater).
(On the web, [Web Bundles](https://web.dev/web-bundles/) are the next best
alternative in Chrome.) This list is not exhaustive, and Electron.js is
mentioned as a representative apps framework out of several.

##### How big a challenge is this?

There are undeniably a number of capabilities that are missing from the web. In
many cases, they are "nice-to-have", but not necessarily required for a still
great experience. Carefully assess if a capability can be seen as a progressive
enhancement. For an example of this approach, check out the article
[Progressively enhance your Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressively-enhance-your-pwa/).

#### Discoverability in stores

Collectively, we have educated users to look for apps in app stores. Some stores
such as the
[Windows Store](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-store/pwa/) and
the
[Android Play Store](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity/quick-start/)
have started to embrace (wrapped!) PWAs (optionally
[limited to ChromeOS](https://chromeos.dev/en/publish/pwa-in-play#chrome-os-only)),
and offer graphical user interface tools like
[PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) (internally based on the command line
tool [bubblewrap](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap)) for
submitting applications. Meanwhile, on other stores such as Apple's App Store,
the situation is different and less welcoming, and apps
[may or may not](https://blog.pwabuilder.com/posts/publish-your-pwa-to-the-ios-app-store/)
make it into the App Store, depending on the outcome of the app review.
Recently, Oculus, a division of Meta Platforms that produces virtual reality
headsets, has announced that PWAs would be accepted into the
[Oculus Store](https://developer.oculus.com/pwa/).

##### How big a challenge is this?

If your users are on one of the platforms whose stores accept PWAs, you can
publish your app to the stores in question. Remember linkability as one of the
web's super powers. Your app is discoverable, advertisable, and linkable from
the web, too. Investing in a memorable domain name can sometimes actually be
better for discoverability. Even for app stores, people still rely most on
recommendations from friends and family members to discover new apps according
to
[research done by Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/_qs/documents/331/how-users-discover-use-apps-google-research.pdf).

#### Monetization of apps and in-app content

Apart from making apps themselves available for a fee, apps can also be
monetized by selling items as in-app purchases (for example, items in a game
app), or by selling subscriptions (for example, regular courses in a fitness
app). If the developer integrates with payment providers, all of this is
available to web apps as well, but the smooth integration of stores and their
related payment systems make this a lot more attractive for platform-specific
apps, albeit at a 15–30% commission. For apps built using
[Trusted Web Activities](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity/)
and delivered through the Google Play Store, developers can now use the
[Payment Request API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API)
and the new
[Digital Goods API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity/receive-payments-play-billing/)
to integrate with Google Play Billing.

##### How big a challenge is this?

When you profit from the convenience of app store billing or in-app purchases,
at the same time you also leave a part of your benefits on the table as a
commission. As a matter of fact, some apps that <em>are</em> published to app
stores even ask their users to make the purchase off-store. One well-known
example is
[Netflix with their external subscriptions](https://9to5mac.com/2022/07/22/netflix-external-subscription-ios/).

#### Hiring or retraining developers

From personal experience through talking to many of Google's partners, a lot of
[companies struggle with hiring great web developers](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-hiring-is-so-hard-in-tech-c462c3230017).
The talent shortage is real, and recruiting costs are high, which is why
startups commonly hire in-house recruiters who often approach recruiting with a
breadth-first approach that has not helped the reputation of recruiters with IT
professionals. Also, companies often already employ teams of Android and/or iOS
developers that they cannot just retrain to become web developers. Creating a
PWA requires a high level of specialization that not all web developers can
offer.

##### How big a challenge is this?

In the current economic situation, hiring <em>any</em> kind of developer is
difficult. Hiring someone with web development skills is, in comparison to other
platform-specific coding skills, still easier
[according to StackOverflow surveys](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-language-prof),
which (in part) also explains the popularity of app frameworks such as React
Native, Ionic, Flutter, and others that are based on web technologies.

#### Existing apps legacy (and migrating the user base)

It is not unusual for companies to have made massive investments in
platform-specific apps, and giving up these investments, as well as a user base
acquired over time (not to speak of the vanity install statistics), is not easy.
Apparently, starting from scratch, even when a company has an existing website,
appears very unattractive in comparison, but sometimes it does
[happen](https://www.glossy.co/ecommerce/gone-fishin-patagonia-bids-farewell-to-mobile-app/).

##### How big a challenge is this?

Vanity is vanity, but once you have set up new, potentially more meaningful,
tracking metrics than number of app installs such as
<a href="https://web.dev/betty-crocker/#results">increase of indicators of
purchase intent</a>, you can start tracking those instead.

#### Compatibility with relevant browsers

Web compatibility is still the
[main issue](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/mdn-web-developer-needs-assessment-2020.html#needs-assessment-top-ten-needs)
mentioned in developer surveys like Mozilla's, but also in internal surveys that
Google has run. Having to support specific browsers, avoiding or removing a
feature that doesn't work across browsers, or making a design look or work the
same across browsers are frequently brought up as challenges. Projects such as
[webcompat.com](https://webcompat.com/) collect user-submitted browser bugs and
invite interested developers to fix them. Mozilla operates a
[repository](https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/webcompat-addon) with
interventions and patches to enable individual sites to run successfully in
Firefox. WebKit maintains a
[quirks list](https://trac.webkit.org/browser/webkit/trunk/Source/WebCore/page/Quirks.cpp)
and
[hires WebKit Web Compatibility Analysts](https://jobs.apple.com/search?search=%22WebKit%20Web%20Compatibility%20Analyst%22&sort=relevance).

##### How big a challenge is this?

Compatibility is the top priority for web developers and browser vendors alike.
With feature testing and progressive enhancement, impressive apps which behave
well on all browsers can be built. For an example of this approach, check out
the article
[Progressively enhance your Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressively-enhance-your-pwa/).

#### Tools and framework support

As well as browser compatibility, Mozilla's
[2020 developer survey](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/reports/mdn-web-developer-needs-assessment-2020.html#needs-assessment-top-ten-needs)
likewise showed that developers struggle with tools and frameworks. Supporting
multiple frameworks in the same code base, understanding and implementing
security measures, plus outdated or inaccurate documentation for frameworks and
libraries, and keeping up with the large number of new and existing tools or
frameworks were all cited.

##### How big a challenge is this?

The tooling and framework situation in the web development world is infamous for
being confusing and hard to keep up with. In practice, though, companies would
use one technology and tooling stack and stay true to it for many years. The
world of tech Twitter is one thing, the reality in businesses, where the
decades-old jQuery is still (and by a large amount) the
<a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2021/javascript#libraries-and-frameworks">most
popular framework</a>, is the other.

#### Security (or rather, the theater of security with certificate pinning)

In platform-specific app development, certificate pinning restricts which
certificates are considered valid for a particular app. Instead of allowing any
trusted certificate to be used, developers pin the certificate authority issuer,
public keys, or even end-entity certificates of their choice. Clients connecting
to that server will treat all other certificates as invalid and refuse to make
an HTTPS connection. The hope is that this renders "person-in-the-middle"
attacks impossible, so platform-specific apps are more "secure" than web apps,
where traffic can easily be sniffed with browser DevTools. There are ways to
[circumvent pinned certificates](https://codeshare.frida.re/@akabe1/frida-multiple-unpinning/)
on all platforms, so it is mostly the theater of security at this point.

##### How big a challenge is this?

As outlined
[earlier](https://codeshare.frida.re/@akabe1/frida-multiple-unpinning/),
certificate pinning mostly just increases the effort an attacker has to put into
sniffing your traffic and reverse-engineering the functioning of your app; but
it doesn't make it impossible.

#### Performance limitations

Web applications have seen impressive performance improvements thanks to
advanced technologies such as [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (including
[SIMD](https://v8.dev/features/simd)),
[WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/), and general JavaScript engine
progress in recent years. Nonetheless, a carefully developed, platform-specific
app will typically outperform a web-based application (albeit the situations
where this _actually_ matters may be limited). With even high-performance
audio-editing tools like [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/) (thanks to the
[Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and
[AudioWorklet](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet)),
interactive development environments like
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try), and graphics-editing tools like
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (thanks to WebAssembly), and of course
graphics-intensive games like [Quake](http://www.quakejs.com) (thanks to
[WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) and
[WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/) in the future), the boundaries are
being pushed at a rapid rate.

##### How big a challenge is this?

There are two types of performance problems: those where truly every frame
counts, as in gaming or WebXR experiences, and those where apps feel "janky", or
unreliable. For the latter, new APIs such as the
[View Transitions API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/)
can help. For the former, WebGPU is probably the most promising API on the
horizon. Very rarely, but admittedly sometimes, a device may just be too slow to
render a given experience, which clearly happens with native apps, too, where
developers can specify
[minimum required device capabilities](https://developer.apple.com/support/required-device-capabilities/).

### Why is Flutter so popular?

For [research question ②](#research-question-2), one possible explanation is
that it is a
[Google-backed](https://flutter.dev/#:~:text=Flutter%20is%20Google%27s%20UI%20toolkit%20for%20building%20beautiful%2C%20natively%20compiled%20applications%20for%20mobile%2C%20web%2C%20desktop%2C%20and%20embedded%20devices%20from%20a%20single%20codebase.)
toolkit for _"building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile,
web, desktop, and embedded devices from a single codebase"_. If even Google, as
the maker of Android, trusts Flutter enough to build some of its strategic apps
with it, such as
[Stadia](https://stadia.dev/blog/how-flutter-helped-us-make-stadia-controller-setup-better-for-users/)
(RIP) and [Google Ads](https://flutter.dev/showcase) for both Android and iOS,
and
[Assistant apps](https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/Flutter-io19.html) on
smart display embedded devices, that is quite a signal to send. Also note how
web and desktop are included in Flutter's output options, which means Flutter is
no longer limited to just mobile (with submission into app stores as the
carrot), and the promise is that it reduces the development cost of apps by the
number of targeted platforms. (Prominent target platform omissions so far are
Apple CarPlay, WearOS, WatchOS, and tvOS.)

An argument that is frequently brought up for Flutter is
[hot reloading](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/hot-reload). On the
backend, Flutter also
[plays well with Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios),
so apps are easy to scale. Important for web, and as Flutter was initially
criticized for rendering everything inaccessibly onto a `<canvas>`, the
framework now has
[two different web renderers](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/web-renderers)
it can automatically choose from:

- **HTML renderer:** This renderer uses a combination of HTML elements, CSS,
  canvas elements, and SVG elements, and has a smaller download size.
- **CanvasKit renderer:** This renderer is fully consistent with Flutter mobile
  and desktop, has faster performance with higher widget density, but adds about
  2 MB in download size.

By default, Flutter selects the HTML renderer when the app is running in a
mobile browser, and the CanvasKit renderer when the app is running in a desktop
browser.

Flutter relies on
[a library of pre-made widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets)
called Cupertino (for the iOS-native look) and Material (for the Android-native
look) that allow developers to quickly develop a good-looking application with a
shared code base. It is worth noting that Flutter-built user interfaces are
platform-agnostic because Flutter’s [Skia](https://skia.org/) rendering engine
does not require any platform-specific UI components. (A downside of this
approach of wrapping everything the app needs instead of reusing platform
primitives directly is app size.)

Apps in Flutter are developed in Dart, an object-oriented programming language
that supports both just-in-time (JIT) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.
Flutter compiles directly to native ARM or Intel x64 code, which has a lot of
performance advantages. Dart is also easy to pick up for developers coming from
any other object-oriented programming language.

Flutter’s [documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) is generally recognized as
best in class and its [cookbook application](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
makes getting started with a baseline scaffolding a simple copy and paste job.
The Flutter community is thriving and it's easy to find help if you are stuck.

## Conclusions

It is undeniable that amazing apps can be built on the web. Photoshop, VS Code,
and Twitter are the stand-out examples in this article, but there are many
others. One of the web's super powers is its linkability, which is hard to beat
on platforms other than the web. There seems to be a certain tendency for
cross-platform app frameworks to become less attractive to developers, with the
notable exception of Flutter, which allows for web as one of its target
platforms. Reasons for _not_ building for the web are easy to find, but it is
also not hard to find counter-arguments to take these reasons apart. Some of
them rely on outdated or weak assumptions, for example, PWAs not being welcome
on app stores, or platform-specific apps being more secure than PWAs. Others are
things that are in process, like closing the app gap by adding missing web
platform APIs. Some reasons apply equally to both worlds, for example, for
hiring to be a challenge. I could go on, but in the end it all boils down to the
concrete circumstances your use case needs to be built for. In this article, I
have given a number of really strong arguments for building for the web, while
also not hiding the fact that the web is a platform that is still not perfect,
and pointing out that other alternatives exist. And as the three stand-out
examples have shown, the decision is also not mutually exclusive. You can build
a powerful web app, and have a great, platform-specific application at the same
time. It is up to you to decide if you want to. And as I said in the title:
_"Not everyone's currently building for the web, but probably more people
should"_. In my humble opinion.

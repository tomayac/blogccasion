On yesterday's 12 hours train ride back to Grenoble I had some time to think
about my iPod.<br />
<br />
<b>Thumb ups</b><br />
<br />
I pretty much love its <b>design</b> and <b>storage capacity</b> (at present I
own about 12GB of MP3 music). I replaced the original iPod ear phones with
Sennheiser ear phones but this was less a measure of improvement of the already
<b>excellent sound</b>, than a measure of camouflage in order to attract less
attention from potential iPod robbers.<br />
<br />
<b>Thumb downs</b><br />
<br />
But there are also some things I don't like:
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>iTunes</b> is big, dull and over-sized in my opinion. I neither want to
    manage and organize my music with iTunes nor do I want to get QuickTime and
    background services installed. iTunes forces me to do so.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>ID3 tags</b> are a great thing if they are used consequently. I don't. I
    have managed my collection in folders sorted by artist, style and album.
    This way I can listen to music for hours without changing the style (i.e.
    listen to French HipHop). The iPod forces me to use ID3 tags to sort my
    music and does not keep to the folder structure I use on my desktop.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Long titles</b> are just cropped in the list views. I would prefer
    scrolling them because I have lots of album titles like
    <i>BAP - 1984 - Zwesche Salzjebäck un Bier</i>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Power consumption</b> is not too bad when playing but what I dislike a
    lot is that I cannot leave my iPod untouched for three weeks, because it
    runs out of battery then. I would prefer a <b>physical power off option</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>back side</b> of the iPod looks really cool - when it is polished and
    never gets touched. IMHO brushed aluminium would have been just as elegant
    but less finger print sensitive.
  </li>
</ul>
<br />

/>I really <u>know</u> my music collection. The 12GB have slowly grown and reach
back to 1998. For me it is important to have proper file names and consistent
namings (always <i>feat.</i> instead of <i>featuring</i>, <i>&</i> or
<i>and</i> for example). As I am aware of new tracks I
<b>don't need the synchronize feature</b> of iTunes. I would prefer to just drop
the new file in the particular folder and done.<br />
<br />
Hope the
<a href="http://ipodlinux.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">iPod Linux Project</a>
will support the 4G iPods officially soon. Maybe I can implement some of my
wishes in the OpenSource software then. And I am looking forward to playing Doom
of course…

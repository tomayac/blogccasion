/><b>Dear APIlity users,</b><br />
<br />
<br />
It took a long time but hopefully the new reference has been worth waiting for.
As of today, you can use the new <b>reference</b> from the known location:<br />
<br />
<br />
•
<a href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html" target="_blank"
  >www.google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html</a
><br />
<br />
There is also a <b>standalone version</b> available which is recommanded to
download:<br />
<br />

<a
  href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/APIlity_Reference_Standalone.html"
  target="_blank"
  >www.google-apility.sourceforge.net/APIlity_Reference_Standalone.html</a
><br />
<br />
The new reference includes:<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    <b
      ><span style="font-family: courier, fixed-width; color: darkblue"
        >Syntax-highlighted </span
      ><span style="color: red">(</span
      ><span style="font-family: courier, fixed-width; color: darkblue"
        >samples</span
      ><span style="color: red">)</span></b
    >
    for straightforward coding
  </li>
  <li>
    A <b>Quicknavigatior system</b> with
    <b
      ><span style="font-size: 1.1em"
        ><span style="color: blue">g</span><span style="color: red">o</span
        ><span style="color: rgb(255, 215, 0)">o</span
        ><span style="color: rgb(255, 215, 0)">g</span
        ><span style="color: blue">l</span
        ><span style="color: darkgreen">e</span
        ><span style="color: red">y</span></span
      ></b
    >
    colors for easy orientation in the reference sections
  </li>
  <li>
    The possibility to directly <b>link to every function</b> for easy support
    from Google-side and direct references for questions about a particular
    function
  </li>
  <li>
    With the new <b>Quicknavigator</b>, the
    <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/adwords-api-php" target="_blank"
      >APIlity forum</a
    >
    and
    <a href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"
      >APIlity home</a
    >
    are just a click away
  </li>
  <li>
    The new reference is pure <b>CSS layouted XHTML</b> which provides maximum
    compatibility with hopefully every current browser (unlike the old XML-based
    version)
  </li>
  <li>
    It is single-paged and therefore can be easily searched (I
    <u>love</u> Firefox's "search-as-you-type" function for this purpose)
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<b>How it works</b><br />
<br />
In the background there is still the
<a href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.xml" target="_blank"
  >ugly XML file</a
>
which holds all data. This file in future will be autogenerated by the code. By
now it is maintained manually, which already is a lot easier than maintaining
the whole XHTML web site.<br />
To create the XHTML file, the XML is parsed in a <b>XPATH-like way</b> but as
XPATH currently does not yet support all features needed (like live PHP
processing and ugly nested tags), I developed an XML parser which completely
imitates the behaviour I have or which I would like to have in XPATH.<br />
<ol>
  <li>The functions get separated by WSDL services</li>
  <li>
    Then they are sorted alphabetically and split up in object and class
    functions
  </li>
  <li>
    Afterwards the WSDL service information and the native API service
    information are added
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally for each function family the particular section with its own color
    bar and link color class are created
  </li>
  <li>
    Static information like the introduction and the organigram and hierarchy
    image are added
  </li>
</ol>
Technologies used: PHP5 (SimpleXML), CSS, JavaScript.<br />
<br />
Hope you like the new reference. Feel free to leave a comment about the updated
reference. Thanks.

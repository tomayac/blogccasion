<b>Dear APIlity users,</b><br />

/>The latest release of
<a href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">APIlity</a> is
ready. This one took a little longer but after a long coding marathon it is
finally ripe to be pushed into the wild. Click here to

can be seen here. This release includes some new features like:<br />
<ul>
  <br />
  <li>
    <b>GeoTargets</b><br />
    Now supports all GeoTargets (cities, countries, metros, regions)<br />
    <div style="padding: 0em 0em 0em 3em">
      <small
        ><u>IMPORTANT:</u><br />
        this comes along with changes to the object structure of Campaign
        objects.<br />
        The old "countries" attribute has been <i>replaced</i> by two new
        attributes:<br />
        1) "geoTargetType" attribute<br />
        2) "geoTargets" attribute</small
      >
    </div>
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <b>Test Suite</b><br />
    APIlity now comes with a complete test suite (view the Readme_TestSuite.txt
    file for details)<br />
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <b>Documentation</b><br />
    The documentation (mainly index.html) was updated and now covers all
    changes.
    <a href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"
      >Check the docs out</a
    >
    here.<br />
  </li>
  <br />
</ul>
<br />
Nathan White also pointed to a
<font color="red">possible security issue</font> with authentication.ini. Please
<a href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"
  >read the "Getting started" section</a
>
of the docs. Nothing to worry about, but to be aware of.<br />
<br />
The next release will finally introduce the in-doc samples (I wanted to push the
release now, samples can be copied & pasted from the test suite meanwhile). In
addition to that APIlity will include the Criterion service. It is planned to
support the best out of both worlds transparently till the Keyword service gets
disabled.<br />
<br />
Does anyone already have a <b>Criterion.php</b> implementation? If so feel free
to become part of the APIlity developer crew by emailing it to tomac AT google
DOT com. Thanks in advance for your contribution to the APIlity project!

    >complete ChangeLog</a
  >.<br />
  <br />
  An update is
  <u>recommended</u>
  to avoid errors with the
  <b
    >changed WSDL in the<br />
    TrafficEstimator service</b
  >.<br />
  <br />
  I am currently about to re-design the docs. I would like
  <b>syntax-highlighted samples</b
  >, an
  <b>easy-to-maintain XML reference file</b>
  and an
  <b>automatically generated XHTML</b>
  file which looks good in all browsers and can be used offline and online (i.e.
  I don't want to maintain two files for the online docs and the shipped docs).
  This seems to be a little much and I am either not supporting all browsers or
  need to do the syntax highlighting manually as I cannot get the XSL-generated
  PHP code interpreted. I keep working to find a solution which works and which
  I can live with.
</ol>

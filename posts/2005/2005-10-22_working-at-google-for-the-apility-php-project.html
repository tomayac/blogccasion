Being in the happy position of
<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/jobs/index.html" target="_blank"
  >working at Google</a

as a part-time contractor from Grenoble, France

as a Software Engineer and AdWords API evangelist, I would like to blog about
the inside story of my work life. My current project is the
<a href="http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"
  >APIlity PHP library</a
>
for Google's advertising program AdWords which can be managed by a web front-end
or, with the right tools, a lot more comfortable via the
<a href="http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/" target="_blank">AdWords API</a>.
<br />
<br />
The APIlity PHP Library provides an object-oriented way to easily access and
manage the Google AdWords API from within PHP. This comes along with an
abstraction from the SOAP and WSDL details.<br />
<br />
At present I am about to add all possible <b>geoTargets</b> to the Campaign
objects and thus giving advertisers all possibilities they need to advertise
wherever they want.<br />
<br />
In addition to that I am writing a <b>test suite</b> which will spin off the
<b>in-doc samples</b> I have promised for a long time. This kills two birds with
one stone or, as we less brutally say in Germany, hits two flies with one fly
swat.<br />
<br />
The <b>Roadmap of APIlity</b> as of October 14th is:<br />
<div style="margin: 2em">
  <b>1.0.1</b><br />
  Support all geo targets (implemented)<br />
  In-Doc samples (slowly grows)<br />
  Use native GZip report function (implemented)<br />
  <br />
  <b>1.0.2</b><br />
  Dual Criterion/Keyword service usage (best out of both worlds)<br />
  Test suite for testing all functions<br />
  <br />
  <b>1.x.y</b><br />
  Migration from XML DOM-ing to XML parsing<br />
  Criterion service only (Keyword service will be history)<br />
  MySQL layer (something like a local DB cache)<br />
  Whatever the community suggests (well, almost whateverâ€¦)

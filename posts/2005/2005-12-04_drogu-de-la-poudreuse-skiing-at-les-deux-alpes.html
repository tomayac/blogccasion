Not so much because of the skiing region but because of the powder snow. The view was very limited and I drove more on the sensations of my feet than on the sensations of my eyes. Cruising through the powder snow which reached up to the knees was just gigantic.<br />
<br />
However, the ski slopes where not that unique. To be honest, I doubt whether it was worth making accessible the glacier. <b>Destroying one of the Alp's last glacial regions</b> seems a big price for some more ski-drivable weeks a year… I don't feel like abolishing skiing, I just wished <b>alpine tourism would be sustainable</b>.<br />
<br />
Grenoble in my opinion has taken an important step: there are driving normally scheduled public-transit busses directly to the skiing regions in reach. So <b>accessing the Alps by public transport</b>, and <b>only when it is skiing season</b> is a part of sustainable tourism. Everbody can contribute his or her part to sustainability: <b>…</b><a href ="http://www.worldprayers.org/frameit.cgi?/archive/prayers/adorations/to_everything_there_is.html" target="_blank">to everything there is a season</a><b>…</b>, ecclesiastes 3:1-8. Der Umkehrschluss ist zulässig. <small>(So in reverse). Sorry, I find no better way to express the same in English. Sometimes you just can't replace your mother tongue.</small>

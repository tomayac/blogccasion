/><b>Strange products the world doesn't need</b><br />
<br />
Usually I am immune against products created by food designers. In my divine
world order jelly, jam and marmalade are made out of strawberries, raspberries,
apricots and - well, fruits in general. There may be a
<b>long tradition of French people being weird</b>, but I didn't know that it is
possible to make <i>confiture</i> out of <b>chestnuts</b>
<small>(Kastanien, châtaignes)</small>. To be honest, it isn't possible.
<b>Bonne Maman</b>, a French company who tried, in my humble opinion failed.
They took 38 grams of chestnuts on 100 grams of sugar and when they noticed that
it didn't taste very well, they added pure vanilla extract. So the outcome
tastes like vanilla pudding mixed with a little caramel pudding. I keep being
open-minded anyway.<br />

<b>A Chrome extension that actually implements xkcd #37. Yeah, for real.</b
><br />
<br />
Albeit famous exceptions exist in form of Wikis, the Web today is still mostly a
read-only experience. This leaves the Web content consumer exposed to all sorts
of typographic cruelties, such as representing the ellipsis character '&hellip;'
with three single full stops "...", incorrect usage of a normal space where a
non-breaking space would be preferred and even omission of the Oxford commaâ€¦
While fighting the cause, namely sloppy Web authors, is like a fight against
wind mills and certainly impossible to realize on Web scale, fighting the
symptoms is a realistic option. Using client-side work-arounds, the Web can
actually be fixed one page at a time. With the

  >xkcd #37 Chrome extension</a
>, we show how via part-of-speech tagging and JavaScript DOM event listeners,
the Web can be made a better place.<br />
<br />
On a related note, this extension has the <b>bad ass-feature</b> of actually
implementing <a href="http://xkcd.com/37/">xkcd #37</a>. Yeah, for real!<br />

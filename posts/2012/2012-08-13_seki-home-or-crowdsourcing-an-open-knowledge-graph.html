<b>SEKI@home, or Crowdsourcing an Open Knowledge Graph</b><br />
<br />
In May 2012, the Web search engine Google has introduced the so-called Knowledge
Graph, a graph that understands real-world entities and their relationships to
one another. It currently contains more than 500 million objects, as well as
more than 3.5 billion facts about and relationships between these different
objects. Soon after its announcement, people started to ask for a Knowledge
Graph Application Programming Interface (API), however, as of today, Google does
not provide one. With
<a
  href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pcpnfphfckcddgdbgjpfdifnmfjcpcae/"
  >SEKI@home</a
>, which stands for Search for Embedded Knowledge Items, we propose a browser
extension-based approach to crowdsource such an API. As people with the
extension installed search on Google.com, the extension sends extracted
anonymous Knowledge Graph facts from Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) to a
centralized, publicly accessible triple store, and thus over time creates a
SPARQL-queryable
<a href="http://openknowledgegraph.org/">Open Knowledge Graph</a>. The SPARQL
endpoint for the Open Knowledge Graph is available at
<a href="http://openknowledgegraph.org/sparql"
  >http://openknowledgegraph.org/sparql</a
>. This prototype browser extension is tailored to the Google Knowledge Graph,
however, we note that the concept of SEKI@home is generalizable for other
knowledge bases.<br />
<br />
A paper describing the technical details of this extension has been submitted to
the First International Workshop on
<a href="http://blogs.ecs.soton.ac.uk/knowledgeextraction/"
  >Knowledge Extraction and Consolidation from Social Media</a
>
(KECSM2012).<br />
<br />
The extension was mainly developed by

  associated with Google. Make fair use of it.</small

<b>AVM FRITZ!Box 7270 Wi-Fi Router</b><br />
<br />
I have finally treated ourselves to a decent Wi-Fi router with integrated DSL
modem at home: a shiny new "Made in Germany"

After hesitating for a long time and fiddling with (i) the crappy Wi-Fi router
with integrated DSL modem that our ISP Alice (Hansenet) have provided us with,
or (ii) a combination of an older Wi-Fi FON router together with a separate DSL
modem, I have finally jumped the cliff and bought a FRITZ!Box despite the maybe
a bit steep price tag of almost 200&#8364;. You can make a good bargain by
buying used ones, or getting branded ones (mine has a 1&1 branding, but the
inertia are exactly the same as the original FRITZ!Box). Make sure to get the
latest version, which is v3 (not sure what exactly is the difference to earlier
versions, but hey, we always want the latest and greatest).<br />
<br />
Finally we can use our LAN (not Wi-Fi) printer on <i>all</i> machines, have the
full 10&ndash;12MBit (typography nerds, I have used an en dash here!) connection
even in the last corner of the apartment, the network-enabled stereo system
plays music without stuttering, we have a fax, can connect DECT and cable
landline phones, make SIP calls, have DynDNS updates, and, yeah, browse the Web
anywhere! Bonus points for the detailed energy monitor and night-off mode (I'm
pretty anal about saving energy). To some, these features might sound trivial,
but we are exploring an entirely new world.<br />
<br />
Our requirements are actually simple: connect Wi-Fi devices in the whole
apartment including the balcony, which should be able to use a shared laser
printer with an Ethernet LAN connection. With all previous connection options we
could either reach full apartment Wi-Fi coverage but no printer connection (as
the FON router has no LAN port), or printer connection but no full Wi-Fi
coverage (as the crappy Alice router is too weak antenna-wise), or, as a last
resort, use too many devices in combination (DSL modem, Alice Wi-Fi router for
the printer and FON router for all other devices).<br />
<br />
Short message: if you're looking for an energy-efficient, fast Wi-Fi router with
integrated DSL modem and excellent Wi-Fi coverage, look no further! I should
have bought this baby earlier.<br />

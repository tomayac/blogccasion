<b>Knowledge Graph Socializer Chrome extension</b><br />
<br />
In May 2012, the Web search engine Google has introduced the so-called
<a
  href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not.html"
  >Knowledge Graph</a
>, a graph that understands real-world entities and their relationships to one
another. Entities covered by the Knowledge Graph include landmarks, celebrities,
cities, sports teams, buildings, movies, celestial objects, works of art, and
more. The graph enhances Google search in three main ways: by disambiguation of
search queries, by search log-based summarization of key facts, and by
explorative search suggestions.<br />

With the
<a
  href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/idakmgndioacjfajieoejpedgiaekjbg/details"
  >Knowledge Graph Socializer</a
>
Chrome extension, we suggest a fourth way of enhancing Web search: through the
addition of realtime coverage of what people say about real-world entities on
social networks. This browser extension seamlessly adds relevant microposts from
the social networking sites <a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google+</a>,
<a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, and
<a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> in form of a panel to Knowledge Graph
entities. In a true <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Data</a> fashion, we
interlink detected concepts in microposts with Freebase entities.<br />
<br />
Please note: you need a freely available Google API key if you want to use the
<a

  >Knowledge Graph Socializer</a
>
extension.

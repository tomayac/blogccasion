<b>Did you think that you were dreaming? - Sometimes I don't know...</b><br />
<p>It has been a long day, and it has been a long week, too. We finally have arrived in Hamburg, Germany, and, at least for the moment, have left Barcelona, Spain, behind us. We live in a nice neighborhood in a beautiful suburb of Hamburg named <a href="http://www.winterhude.com/183-0-fotos-aus-winterhude.html">Winterhude</a>.</p><p><b>Many things have changed</b>. I am no longer working from home, in contrast Laura now is. Our baby daughter Lena slowly adapts to the new climate and the different environment (Laura takes a little longer), and finally we are close to un-boxing all our stuff after the move. Fun things happen, like IKEA delivering a small closet to the wrong person, which results in the person being so happy about the unexpected piece of furniture that she wants to keep it and buy us a new one this coming Friday. Seriously, we are looking forward to finally mounting it on the weekend...</p><p><b>Some things keep being the same</b>. For example I am still travelling a lot for work. Today I am in London. Had some fun with the booked and confirmed hotel eventually being over-booked, and have now been relocated to a hotel close to Tower Bridge. 10<sup>th</sup> floor, beautiful view (sorry for the crappy cell phone camera picture):</p><img src="./images/13.Mar.2008_1.jpg" alt="London Skyline by Night" /><p>Life is good, though, however full of surprises and unexpected detours. Good that with all the London stress, the airport hectic pace, and the loved ones being far away and without even a phone connection for the moment, there is still good music to relax with and think of perfectly lucky moments. <i>Did you think that you were dreaming? - Sometimes I don't know...</i>, please put on good headphones, turn your stereo's volume up to the maximum, and share <b>Counting Crows - Round Here</b> in the live version as to be found <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=eA6F4Y2x_Sg">on YouTube</a> with me:</p><br />

<b>Foto ABC for iPhone by Esquimal Apps launched on the AppStore</b><br />
<br />
My wife Laura is super proud of her very first iPhone app <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/foto-abc/id416452467?mt=8">Foto ABC</a> that went live on the AppStore on February 1, 2011 (and I'm obviously very proud of her). The app is for learning the alphabet and is localized in five languages: English, French, Spanish, German, and Catalan, Laura's native language. She put a lot of work into the selection of really nice photos, all Creative Commons licensed. If you like the app, don't hesitate to "Like" her official <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Esquimal-Apps/190286484323303">Foto ABC Facebook page</a> or follow her on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/esquimalapps">@esquimalapps</a>). You can see a screencast of the app below:<br />

Get <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/foto-abc/id416452467?mt=8">Foto ABC</a> on the AppStore for 1.59â‚¬ (or $1.99).<br />

Update: I entirely failed to add a link to <a href="http://www.laura-torrent.com">Laura's (or Esquimal Apps') homepage</a>. Done now!

<b>International Conference on Next Generation Web Services Practices (NWeSP 2011)</b><br />
<br />
These days I'm attending the International Conference on <a href="http://www.mirlabs.org/nwesp11/">Next Generation Web Services Practices</a> (NWeSP 2011), which takes place in Salamanca, Spain. Together with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/rubenverborgh">Ruben Verborgh</a>, I have two papers there, the first one is titled <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub37426.html">Adding Meaning to Facebook Microposts via a Mash-up API and Tracking Its Data Provenance</a>, the second one is titled <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub37427.html">Efficient Runtime Service Discovery and Consumption with Hyperlinked RESTdesc</a>, where <a href="http://restdesc.org/">RESTdesc</a> is mainly a brain child of Ruben. The slides for the first paper can be seen below: <br />

The old town was <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/381">declared a UNESCO world heritage</a> in 1988. What I specifically like about the city is a tiny detail. Most public and private buildings and even things like the municipal bike rental system <a href="http://salamanca.onroll.info/">SalEnBici</a> all use a beautiful antique font: the freely available <a href="http://www.dafont.com/universitas-studii-salamantini.font">Universitas Studii Salamantini</a> font, which historically was used for graffitis that were written with bull blood. So goes the legend at least.<br />

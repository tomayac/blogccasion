<b>W3C RDF Working Group - JSON Syntax Options</b><br />
<br />
I'm a member of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/wiki/Main_Page">W3C RDF Working Group</a>
whose objective (among others) is to come up with a way to serialize
<a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf">RDF</a> triples in
<a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>. Below is a presentation on syntax options
that I have prepared for the first face-to-face meeting of the Working Group in
Amsterdam from April 13 to 14, which unfortunately I can only attend
remotely.<br />

<b>Thesis Proposal Passed</b><br />
<br />
After a tough rehearsal session with my tutor at
<a href="http://www.upc.edu/">UPC.edu</a> yesterday evening, today I have
successfully passed the thesis proposal defense in front of a university
committee. The viva voce slides can be seen below. Thanks to my tutors
<a href="http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~gabarro/">Kim Gabarró Vallès</a> from UPC and

from <a href="http://www.deri.ie/">DERI</a> for their very valuable input.
Thanks to
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/arnaudbrousseau">Arnaud Brousseau</a> for taking
over most of the
<a href="http://www.isearch-project.eu/isearch/">I-SEARCH</a> work in the last
few weeks, so that I could focus on

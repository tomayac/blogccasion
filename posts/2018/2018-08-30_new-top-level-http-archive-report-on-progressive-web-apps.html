  As a follow-up from the

  from a couple of weeks ago, we're now happy to announce that we've landed a
  new top-level
  <a
    href="https://httparchive.org/reports/progressive-web-apps"
    rel="nofollow noopener"
    >HTTP Archive report on Progressive Web Apps</a
  >
  based on the study's raw data.
</p>
<p>
  This report currently encompasses two sections: <em>(i)</em>
  <a
    href="https://httparchive.org/reports/progressive-web-apps#pwaScores"
    rel="nofollow noopener"
    >PWA Scores</a
  >
  and <em>(ii)</em>
  <a
    href="https://httparchive.org/reports/progressive-web-apps#swControlledPages"
    rel="nofollow noopener"
    >Service Worker Controlled Pages</a
  >, which translates roughly to

  mentioned above.

  You can use this data for example to see the
  <a
    href="https://httparchive.org/reports/progressive-web-apps?start=2017_08_01&amp;end=latest&amp;view=list#swControlledPages"
    rel="nofollow noopener"

  over time based on Chrome <code>ServiceWorkerControlledPage</code>

  statistics. Good news: the trend is going up.

  As a result of

  feature, you can now also dive into the data in an even more fine-grained
  manner, for example, to see the development of
  <a
    href="https://httparchive.org/reports/progressive-web-apps?lens=wordpress&amp;start=2017_08_01&amp;end=latest&amp;view=list#pwaScores"

    >median Lighthouse scores of just the <strong>Wordpress</strong> universe</a
  >. Note that while there was a switch in the Lighthouse scoring algorithm from
  <a
    href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/scoring#pwa"
    rel="nofollow noopener"
    >v2</a

  to
  <a
    href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/v3/scoring#pwa"
    rel="nofollow noopener"
    >v3</a
  >
  of the tool, the chart shows the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median" rel="nofollow noopener"
    >median</a
  >
  score, which naturally is more robust in the presence of outliers.

  Next steps entail also getting the data from

  of the study into the <code>httparchive.technologies.*</code> tables, so that
  we can allow everyone to run

    rel="nofollow noopener"
    >BigQuery analyses</a

  on top of these in a cost-efficient manner, without having to go through the
  massive (70+ TB) <code>httparchive.response_bodies.*</code> tables!

  Big thanks to

  again, whose guidance and leadership were essential to make this happen. We're
  looking forward to this data being put to good use.

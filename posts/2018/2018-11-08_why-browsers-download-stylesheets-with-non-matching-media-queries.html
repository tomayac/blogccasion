<p>
  The other day, I read an article by
  <a href="https://github.com/dgieselaar">Dario Gieselaar</a> on
  <a
    href="https://medium.com/zoover-engineering/optimizing-css-by-removing-unused-media-queries-80b5508c6de9"
    >Optimizing CSS by removing unused media queries</a
  >. One of the core ideas is that you can use the
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#attr-media"
    ><code>media</code> attribute</a
  >
  when including your stylesheets like so:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link href="print.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print"&gt;
&lt;link href="mobile.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 600px)"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
  In the article, Dario links to
  <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl">Scott Jehl</a>'s
  <a href="http://scottjehl.github.io/CSS-Download-Tests/"
    >CSS Downloads by Media Query</a
  >
  test suite where Scott shows how
  <em
    >browsers would still download stylesheets even if their media queries are
    non-matching</em
  >.
</p>
<p>
  I
  <a
    href="https://github.com/scottjehl/CSS-Download-Tests/issues/11#issue-378471829"
    >pointed out</a
  >
  that the priority of these downloads is <code>Lowest</code>, so they're at
  least not competing with core resources on the page:
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/145676/48161126-2073ad80-e2da-11e8-9699-92f7e95cb5b8.png"
    width="412"
    height="252"
    alt="Waterfall diagram showing how stylesheets with non-matching media queries are downloaded at lowest priority"
  />
</p>
<p>
  At first sight this still seemed suboptimal, and I thought that even if the
  priority is <code>Lowest</code>, maybe the browser shouldn't trigger downloads
  at all. So I did some research, and, surprise, it turns out that the CSS spec
  writers and browser implementors are actually pretty darn smart about this:
</p>
<p>
  The thing is, the user <em>could</em> always decide to resize their window
  (impacting
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/width"
    >width</a
  >,
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/height"
    >height</a
  >,
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/aspect-ratio"
    >aspect ratio</a
  >), to
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#Media_types"
    >print</a
  >
  the document, <em>etc.</em>, and even things that at first sight
  <em>seem</em> static (like the
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/resolution"
    >resolution</a
  >) can change when a user with a multi-screen setup moves a window from say a
  <em>Retina</em> laptop screen to a bigger desktop monitor, or the user can
  unplug their
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/any-pointer"
    >mouse</a
  >, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  Truly static things that can't change (a TV device can't suddenly turn into
  something else) are actually being <em>deprecated</em> in
  <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries">Media Queries Level 4</a> (see
  the
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#Media_types"
    >yellow note box</a
  >); and the recommendation is to rather target
  <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries/#media-feature"
    >media features</a
  >
  instead (see the text under the
  <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries/#media-types">red issue box</a
  >).
</p>
<p>
  Finally, even invalid values like <code>media="nonsense"</code> still need to
  be considered, according to the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#ignore">ignore rules</a> in
  the spec.
</p>
<p>
  So long story short, browsers try to be as smart as possible by applying
  priorities, and <code>Lowest</code> is a reasonable value for the cases in
  Scott's <a href="http://scottjehl.github.io/CSS-Download-Tests/">test</a>.

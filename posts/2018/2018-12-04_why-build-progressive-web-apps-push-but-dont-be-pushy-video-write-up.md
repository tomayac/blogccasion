Let‚Äôs face it, on the web, push notifications have become a bit of an
omnipresent annoyance. The reason for the bad reputation of push
notifications‚Äîin my opinion‚Äîis that we have been, well, a bit too _‚Äúpushy‚Äù_ in
trying to get people to allow them.

The folks over at Mozilla have phrased it like this in a
[blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/no-notifications/):

> ‚ÄúOnline, your attention is priceless. That‚Äôs why every site in the universe
> wants permission to send you notifications about new stuff. It can be
> distracting at best and annoying at worst.‚Äù

![Blog post by Mozilla announcing the option to block push notifications globally.](/images/asset-1_copy.jpeg)

A particularly _bad practice_ is to pop up the permission dialog on page load,
without any context at all. Several high traffic sites have been caught doing
this. To subscribe people to push notifications, you use the the
`[PushManager](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager)`
[interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager). Now
to be fair, this does not allow the developer to specify the context or the
to-be-expected frequency of notifications. So where does this leave us?

```
const options = {
  userVisibleOnly: true,
  applicationServerKey: APPLICATION_SERVER_KEY,
  // No way to specify context or frequency ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
};
const subscription = await reg.pushManager.subscribe(options);
```

First, maybe let‚Äôs take one step back and brainstorm why we would want push
notifications in the first place. If done right, **_push notifications are
actually pretty great_**. For example, they can inform you if you have been
_outbid_ on an auction site. They can alert you about _severe weather
conditions_ in your hometown. On a less serious note, they can notify you when
you have a _match on a dating site_. Or they can let you know if there‚Äôs a
significant _price drop_ for something you‚Äôre interested in. And yes, of course
push notifications can also _inform you of new content_ on a news site.

As I wrote above, there is no way on the API-level to inform users about the
context of push notifications. All you can do with the options parameter is set
a flag whether the notifications should be `userVisibleOnly`, and provide the
`applicationServerKey`. In consequence, it‚Äôs crucial that we as application
developers provide the context for our notifications ourselves.

Maybe you remember the
[üêà AffiliCats](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/) sample app from
the [first episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UK_TDTTWnQ) of ‚ÄúWhy Build
Progressive Web Apps.‚Äù It‚Äôs a simple app that simulates a comparison site where
you can get great offers for cats. What‚Äôs new this time is a **_button for
getting price drop_** alerts.

![üêà AffiliCats app with price drop alerts (Source: [https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/)).](/images/asset-2__copy.png)

When you press it for the _very_ first time, the notifications permissions
prompt pops up, and it‚Äôs immediately clear that it‚Äôs related to the price drop
alerts.

If you grant permission, the app subscribes you to a push notification endpoint
that is configured to send out dummy notifications, and after a couple of
seconds after subscribing, you should receive your first notification.

So you can see, prices for cats are dropping, you better get one while they
last. And there we have it, an actually useful push notification. It was
_contextual_, _meaningful_, and _timely_. The
[üêà AffiliCats](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/) app is open
source, go check out the
[source code](https://github.com/googlechromelabs/affilicats) if you want to see
how it‚Äôs implemented. Push notifications are a great power, and with great power
comes great responsibility. If you remember one thing from this write-up, I hope
it‚Äôs **_context matters_**!

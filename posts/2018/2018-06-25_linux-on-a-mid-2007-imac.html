<p>
  We have a 24 inch
  <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP16?locale=en_US">Mid 2007 iMac</a> in
  our living room that is clearly showing its age, but still working OK enough
  (albeit slow) as a TV (SD channels on DVB-C via USB stick), DVD player, and
  Web streaming station. The machine is stuck on
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_El_Capitan">macOS El Capitan</a>
  (OS X version 10.11.6) and doesn't get updates anymore. I was wondering if
  putting Linux on it might help.
</p>

<p>
  I ended up installing
  <a href="https://xubuntu.org/release/18-04/">Xubuntu 18.04 (64 bit)</a>,
  mainly because it uses the lightweight
  <a href="https://xfce.org/">Xfce window manager</a>. For some reason USB boot
  never worked (the same USB pen booted on a MacBook Air just fine), so I went
  and, in 2018, bought some DVD+RWs (probably the last time I ever do this) and
  it booted.
</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<p>
  All hardware was immediately recognized and ready to go, including the
  (proprietary) Wi-Fi drivers, the multimedia keys on the iMac keyboard, the
  mouse wheel (I had to compile a kernel back in
  <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianHamm">Debian 2.0. Hamm</a> times), and
  even the USB TV stick (<a
    href="http://www.hauppauge.de/site/products/data_hvr930chd.html"
    >Hauppauge 930C</a
  >, I needed to
  <a
    href="https://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge_WinTV-HVR-930C#Step_by_step_instructions"
    >copy its firmware</a
  >
  file to <code>/lib/firmwares</code>). The system overall boots a lot faster
  (it's still a spinning HDD and still only has 2GB of RAM) and, once up, feels
  really snappy again (Firefox Quantum is a lot faster than Chrome Beta to
  start, though). Dual boot works fine, everyone recommends
  <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/">rEFInd</a>, so I just went with
  that.
</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p>
  The system still doesn't decode HD DVB-C channels smoothly (<ins
    >it does now, see the update below</ins
  >), despite being on only ~25% CPU load (compared to 99% on macOS where it
  works neither). If there's someone from
  <a href="https://linuxtv.org/">Linux TV</a> reading along, I'd love to talk to
  you. I don't particularly like
  <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Software">Gnome Software</a> that Xubuntu
  ships with instead of
  <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter">Ubunutu Software Center</a>,
  but I fixed this by installing the
  <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/">Synaptic Package Manager</a>.

<p>2018. The year of the Linux desktop <code>:-)</code></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>
  I learned about the <a href="http://www.tvdr.de">VDR project</a> yesterday,
  and after some fiddling now have <strong>HD</strong> DVB-C TV on Xubuntu,
  something that never even worked on macOS. The setup was super involved and
  old-school Linux, but thanks a ton to the Debian folks for the helpful
  <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/VDR#Installing_VDR"
    >instructions to install VDR</a
  >.

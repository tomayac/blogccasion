<p>
  This is a bit of a rant, and a bit of a process documentation. I'm trying to
  submit the
  <a href="https://github.com/google/service-worker-detector"
    >Service Worker Detector</a
  >
  browser extension to the
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/home">Microsoft Store</a>, so
  it can be one of the
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/collections/edgeextensions/"
    >Edge extensions</a
  >
  everyone can easily install via a few mouse clicks. I have to say, the process
  is somewhat involved.

  To start, it's whitelist only, so you have to
  <a href="http://aka.ms/extension-request"
    >apply via the extension submission form</a
  >, which I did. For me, nothing really happened for a long time, so I chased
  down someone from the helpful
  <a href="https://twitter.com/MSEdgeDev">@MSEdgeDev team</a> who pulled some
  internal strings. Ultimately I got an email invite that I may now submit to
  the Store. While you can
  <a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions/guides/creating-an-extension"
    >develop and test extensions locally</a
  >
  mostly the Chrome way (that I am quite familiar with) by just loading the
  extension in developer mode, the process gets more complex for the actual
  Store submission (and required testing):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    First, you need to
    <a
      href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions/guides/packaging/using-manifoldjs-to-package-extensions"
      >package the extension with ManifoldJS</a
    >
    so it becomes an app, so far so good.
    <pre><code>manifoldjs -l debug -p edgeextension -f edgeextension -m service-worker-detector/manifest.json
manifoldjs -l debug -p edgeextension package SWDetector/edgeextension/manifest/</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Next, you need to
    <a
      href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions/guides/packaging/running-the-windows-app-certification-kit"
      >test the resulting app package locally</a
    >
    with the <em>Windows App Certification Kit</em>, also no problem. I just
    went for the
    <a
      href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/windows-app-certification-kit#validate-your-windows-app-using-the-windows-app-certification-kit-from-a-command-line"
      >interactive way</a
    >
    with the graphical user interface tool. This test caught an issue with
    icons, where the syntax
    <code>"browser_action": {"default_icon": "icon.png"}</code> or
    <code>"page_action": {"default_icon": "icon.png"}</code> would not work, but
    where
    <a
      href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions/api-support/supported-manifest-keys#browser_action-or-page_action-keys"
      >explicit sizes are required</a
    >
    instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then, you need to
    <a
      href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/packaging/create-certificate-package-signing"
      >create and export a self-signed certificate</a
    >
    (the CertStoreLocation parameter actually ends in just "My", it's not a
    typo):
    <pre><code>New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -Subject "CN=SUP3R-S3CRET-ID-TH1NG" -KeyUsage DigitalSignature -FriendlyName "Thomas Steiner" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\LocalMachine\My"</code></pre>
    This returns a thumb ID that you need for the export step:
    <pre><code>$pwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String mySecretPassword -Force -AsPlainText
Export-PfxCertificate -cert "Cert:\LocalMachine\My\SUP3RS3CR3TTHUMBPR1NT" -FilePath self-signed-certificate.pfx -Password $pwd</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    You need this certificate in order to
    <a
      href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/packaging/sign-app-package-using-signtool"
      >sign your app package</a
    >
    created by ManifoldJS, which requires you to download and install the
    <a
      href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk"
      >Windows 10 SDK</a
    >
    (and obviously an actual Windows 10 installation). Windows PowerShell would
    not recognize the installed SignTool, so I had to use the
    <a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31869552/how-to-install-signtool-exe-for-windows-10"
      >explicit path</a
    >:
    <pre><code>&amp; 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x64\signtool.exe' sign /fd SHA256 /a /f self-signed-certificate.pfx /p password edgeExtension.appx</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Ultimately, you need to
    <a
      href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/certmgr"
      >add the self-signed certificate to your trusted root certificates</a
    >, but it didn't work as described, so I ended up right-clicking the
    certificate file in Windows Explorer and fat-fingering around in the trust
    settings in the Details tab until it worked and I could install the Edge
    extension <code>.appx</code> file by double-clicking it.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I'm now in the third iteration with their store review team where it's all
  working fine for me locally, but where they say it crashes on their side.
  Let's see how it ends. I guess the core issue is that
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/manifoldjs">ManifoldJS</a> can do a lot
  of things to shield me from something, something
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform"
    >Windows UWP apps</a
  >, but where eventually you still need to read the
  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/packaging/"
    >UWP packaging docs</a
  >
  for the Microsoft Store submission that are clearly not written with extension
  developers in mind, but rather for regular Windows app developers.

  Oh, and another thing I just realized: Edge
  <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=details">doesn't know</a> the
  <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements. It
  <a
    href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/13120279/"
    >used to work</a
  >
  and
  <em
    >"[t]he implementation of this feature had shipped, but its quality was
    found lacking, hence this implementation was removed before Edge shipped
    last release. There currently [as of January 22, 2018] isn't [a] plan
    [Francois R. from the Microsoft Edge Team is] aware of to bring the feature
    back in the next update."</em

  Sad. It is, however, mentioned as <em>Under Consideration</em> on the
  corresponding
  <a
    href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/detailssummary/?q=details"
    >Edge Platform status page</a
  >
  with high priority, so here is hopingâ€¦

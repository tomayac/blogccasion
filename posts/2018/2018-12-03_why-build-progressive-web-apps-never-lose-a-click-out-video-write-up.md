On the Google Chrome Developers
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw), we
have been pushing the concept of Progressive Web Apps (PWA) a fair bit, and
there have been some great [success](https://youtu.be/Xryhxi45Q5M)
[stories](https://youtu.be/SJiKWwBtQaU) of companies building PWAs. But you
might wonder, what may have worked for the mentioned partners, might not
necessarily work for your company. In my new video series called _‚ÄúWhy build
Progressive Web Apps,‚Äù_ I want to show you common **_use-case driven patterns
for applying PWA features_** that set _you_ up for success. In the first
episode, I look at affiliate sites and how they can manage to never lose a
click-out.

You have maybe seen or even used a **_comparison site_** in the past. For
example, to find out what is the cheapest internet provider, or to get the best
hotel offer for your next vacation. Many of these comparison sites rely on
**_commission-based affiliate marketing_**: when you click out to a third-party
vendor site and end up converting, the referring comparison site earns a small
fee. In consequence, such sites want you to click through to the best offer, and
under no circumstances do they want to risk losing a click-out.

Many sessions with comparison sites happen ‚Äúon the go,‚Äù say, on the commute to
work. And while in the majority of cases you might be connected, there are
definitely situations where you lose your connection, like in a tunnel or when
your signal strength drops to just one or two bars, and you end up being _de
facto_ offline. Having an architecture that gives the network some time to
respond, but that gracefully degrades to cached content or fallback placeholder
content, can help improve the user‚Äôs experience drastically.

In order to demonstrate how to deal with such situations, I have created my own
sample comparison site called
[**üêà AffiliCats**](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/) with purely
dummy content, but coming from _real APIs_ like the
[Wikimedia API](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/affilicats/blob/895c27b2f87f377049d477ea90c8927ce52f1fb5/src/js/main.js#L64-L74),
the
[Google Static Maps API](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/affilicats/blob/895c27b2f87f377049d477ea90c8927ce52f1fb5/src/js/main.js#L183-L189),
the
[Random Number API](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/affilicats/blob/895c27b2f87f377049d477ea90c8927ce52f1fb5/src/js/main.js#L202-L204),
the
[Bacon Ipsum API](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/affilicats/blob/895c27b2f87f377049d477ea90c8927ce52f1fb5/src/js/main.js#L202-L204),
and the
[Place Kittens API](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/affilicats/blob/895c27b2f87f377049d477ea90c8927ce52f1fb5/src/js/main.js#L270).

![üêà AffiliCats sample app (Source: [https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/)).](/images/asset-3__.png)

The app has a big search bar on top where you can search for items, like cats.
Each item has an image and a title, as well as offers and a _‚ÄúView Deal‚Äù_ button
that leads to the third-party vendor‚Äôs site. Then we have three tabs with more
_photos_, _reviews_, and the _location_ of the item.

![üêà AffiliCats tabs: photos, reviews, location (Source: [https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/)).](/images/asset-4__.png)

Each tab‚Äôs content is _lazily loaded_ on-demand with one, or multiple, fetch
request. So in each case, the request can either _succeed_, _time out_ if the
network is too slow, or _fail_ from the start if we‚Äôre entirely offline.

![Waterfall diagram showing lazy-loading.](/images/asset-5__.png)

In the latter two cases, we want to respond with _fallback content_, for
example, a ‚Äúreviews took too long to load‚Äù message, or a timeout image. When the
network comes back, or the slow request eventually goes through, we can then
dynamically replace the fallback or placeholder content with real content. The
user can also decide to press ‚Äúreload‚Äù and refresh the complete page. This is
called ‚Äúnavigation request‚Äù. If we‚Äôre offline, we can then show a fallback page
with skeleton content.

![Fallback content in case loading takes too long, offline placeholders, and dynamic¬†loading.](/images/asset-6__.png)

Finally, let‚Äôs see how we can make sure not to lose the click-out. What happens
if the user clicks on the ‚ÄúView Deal‚Äù button when they are offline? Notice how
most of the page is disabled, but the money-making button is still active?

![While the app is offline and most interactive features are disabled, the ‚ÄúView Deal‚Äù button can still be¬†clicked.](/images/asset-7__.png)

A _precached forwarding page_ opens that waits for the connection to come back,
and once online again, it then eventually still realizes the click-out, and
drops our imaginary affiliate cookie‚Ä¶ üí∏

You are invited to
[play with this app](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/) yourself
and read the [source code](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/affilicats). I
hope this has been useful, and maybe you can apply some of these patterns to
your own websites. Thanks for reading, and see or read you for the next episode
of ‚ÄúWhy build Progressive Web Apps,‚Äù where we will look at push notifications.

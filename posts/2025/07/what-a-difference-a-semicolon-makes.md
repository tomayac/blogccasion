The other day, I was hit by a baffling
`TypeError: console.log(...) is not a function`. Like, WTF ðŸ¤”? Turns out, I was
sloppily adding a quick `console.log('here')` statement for debugging purposes
(as one does ðŸ™ˆ), which happened to be right before an
[IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE). I didn't put a
`;`, as it was a throwaway statement I'd remove after finding the bug, but turns
out that's the issue. StackOverflow contributor
[Sebastian Simon](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4642212/sebastian-simon) had
the [explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31013390):

> It's trying to pass `function(){}` as an argument to the return value of
> `console.log()` which itself is not a function but actually undefined (check
> `typeof console.log();`). This is because JavaScript interprets this as
> `console.log()(function(){})`. `console.log` however is a function.

Minimal repro:

```js
console.log()(function () {});
```

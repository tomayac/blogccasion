<b>Dear APIlity users</b>,<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/images/google_small.gif" alt="Google AdWords logo" align="left" /> The <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/google-apility/apility_1.0.1a.zip?download" target="_blank">latest release of APIlity</a> is ready.<br />
<br />
This release includes just small fixes:<br />
<br />
<ol><li><b>TrafficEstimator service</b><br />
APIlity now reflects the changes in the TrafficEstimate service<br />
<ul><li>new attribute "clicksPerDay"</li><li>removed attributes "impressions", "ctr", "notShownPerDay"</li></ul></li><br />
<br />
<li><b>Documentation</b><br />
The documentation has been changed to a proper CSS-based layout.</li><br />
<br />
View the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=144351&release_id=368722" target="_blank">complete ChangeLog</a>.<br />
<br />
An update is <u>recommended</u> to avoid errors with the <b>changed WSDL in the<br />
TrafficEstimator service</b>.<br />
<br />
I am currently about to re-design the docs. I would like <b>syntax-highlighted samples</b>, an <b>easy-to-maintain XML reference file</b> and an <b>automatically generated XHTML</b> file which looks good in all browsers and can be used offline and online (i.e. I don't want to maintain two files for the online docs and the shipped docs). This seems to be a little much and I am either not supporting all browsers or need to do the syntax highlighting manually as I cannot get the XSL-generated PHP code interpreted. I keep working to find a solution which works and which I can live with.

It's not often that I post something with the [Political](/tags/Political) tag
on my blog. In the recent months and probably years, I've in the majority
sticked to [Technical](/tags/Technical) posts, but this one is different. For
folks like me in tech, it's way too easy to limit oneself to just the mostly
uncontroversial (as in: it _truly_ matters) technical stuff and stay silent
about other aspects of life. Yesterday, I watched the
[Triell](https://www.daserste.de/information/nachrichten-wetter/ard-sondersendung/sendung/das-triell-dreikampf-ums-kanzleramt-100.html)
(the TV debate between the three candidates for the German chancellor, Armin
Laschet, Olaf Scholz, and Annalena Baerbock) and I took this as an excuse to
make my political standpoint public. It's uncomfortable and I hesitated a lot,
but I think it's the right thingâ„¢ to do now.

As [Annalena Baerbock](https://annalena-baerbock.de/) from the
[GrÃ¼nen party](https://www.gruene.de/)
[says](https://twitter.com/Die_Gruenen/status/1437142209644711936): _"The next
government is the last one that can still actively influence the climate
crisis."_ You may have heard of the
[2021 floodings in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_European_floods#Germany).
Our response can't be to rebuild and move on. If we continue the
[_laissez faire_](https://www.cdu.de/artikel/armin-laschet-es-geht-um-vertrauen#:~:text=die%20autoindustrie%20ist%20langst%20auf%20dem%20weg.%20wir%20haben%20so%20viel%20kreativitat%20bei%20unseren%20forschern.%20wir%20mussen%20die%20jetzt%20auch%20mal%20machen%20lassen.)
of the German car industry that Mr. Laschet, the candidate of the Christian
Democratic Party CDU, demands, we mainly get electric (or worse, hybrid) SUVs
for 50Kâ‚¬+, but not affordable small cars for regular incomes. We don't need a
[Merkel 2.0](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/world/europe/germany-election-scholz-laschet-baerbock-merkel.html#:~:text=Scholz%20is%20trying%20to%20be%20Merkel%E2%80%99s%20clone%20all%20the%20way%20down%20to%20the%20rhombus)
that Mr. Scholz risks to become with a little bit of COâ‚‚ pricing here and a
little bit of exit from coal energy there.

We need a politics where _"[o]ur children, our grandchildren shouldn't have to
ask us: Why didn't you do anything? But: How did you do
it?"_â€”[Annalena Baerbock](https://twitter.com/Die_Gruenen/status/1437148906803056642).

If you're not super familiar with the current German political pre-election
situation, here's some recommended background reading:

- [Sheâ€™s Green. Sheâ€™s Young. And She Wants to Change Germany.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/world/europe/annalena-baerbock-germany-greens-chancellor.html)
- [It's Election Season in Germany. No Charisma, Please!](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/world/europe/germany-election-scholz-laschet-baerbock-merkel.html)

If you want to join me in going public with your political views, here's how I
did it. It may feel uncomfortable, "cost" you followers or subscribers to your
blog, or maybe even stop people from talking to you (I hope we keep talking,
even if we don't agree with each other), but I think it's worth it.

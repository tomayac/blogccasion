Google I/O 2020, like all the I/O conferences before, was planned as a physical event. But then the
coronavirus struck, and I/O 2020 was the I/O that never was. In 2021, we had enough time to plan, so
I/O 2021 was the first virtual event in the series.

The team outdid themselves and recreated the entire experience as a virtual game. As
[Ars Technica wrote](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/googles-i-o-adventure-was-almost-as-good-as-being-there/),
<cite>Google's I/O Adventure was almost as good as being there</cite>. To get a feel for it, here's
the official [teaser video](https://youtu.be/hMjtFRqaTsI). During the event, you could bump into
Googlers and talk to them, almost like in the real world. Below, you can see a team photo we took at
the obligatory lighthouse. Can you spot me?

Together with [@lipis](https://twitter.com/lipis), I had the pleasure of giving a talk titled
_Excalidraw and Fugu: Improving Core User Journeys_. You can watch the talk in the video embed
below, or [read my video write-up](https://web.dev/excalidraw-and-fugu/) over on web.dev.

I also created a [codelab](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/project-fugu#0) that covers a lot
of the Project Fugu üê° APIs. You can work your way through it at your own pace, or if you want,
re-join me in a virtual workshop session where you see me do it‚Äîand run into some minor service
worker caching issues‚Ä¶ üòÖ

Google I/O 2021 was in my opinion a good event that worked OK enough under the circumstances and
with the constraints of the virtual format. With I/O in the books, we're looking what to do when it
comes to events in the future. Virtual, physical, or hybrid? The planning phase for Chrome Dev
Summit 2021 has already [started](https://paul.kinlan.me/chrome-dev-summit-2021/)‚Ä¶ Stay tuned, and
always root for Team Web!

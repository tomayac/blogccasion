Just a quick note to say that I have released [SVGcode](https://svgco.de/), a
Progressive Web App that lets you convert raster images like JPG, PNG, GIF,
WebP, AVIF, etc. to vector graphics in SVG format. You can find the
[source code on GitHub](https://github.com/tomayac/SVGcode).

To learn more about the features of the app, read my article
[SVGcode: a PWA to convert raster images to SVG vector graphics](https://web.dev/svgcode/)
or watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcvfyQh6J-0) that is also
embedded below.

[SVGcode](https://svgco.de/) is starting to get some coverage, for example, from
[XDA Developers](https://www.xda-developers.com/svgcode-web-app/) and even a
Chinese website called
[ËΩØÈ§ê](https://www.ruancan.com/wangluo/svgcode-convert-ordinary-pictures-to-svg-vector-graphics.html).
To help discoverability, I have also listed it on
[Stefan Judis](https://www.stefanjudis.com/)' collection of
[Tiny Helpers](https://tiny-helpers.dev/svg/#:~:text=SVGcode). With the orange
site it is always give and take, but for now (ü§û),
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29296753) treats the app
quite well. Looking forward to seeing where the app goes.

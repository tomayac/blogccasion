<b>W3C RDF Working Group - JSON Syntax Options</b><br />
<br />
I'm a member of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/wiki/Main_Page">W3C RDF Working Group</a> whose objective (among others) is to come up with a way to serialize <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf">RDF</a> triples in <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>. Below is a presentation on syntax options that I have prepared for the first face-to-face meeting of the Working Group in Amsterdam from April 13 to 14, which unfortunately I can only attend remotely.<br />

<p>
  I've released a new Chrome extension today that detects
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker"
    >Service Workers</a
  >
  in modern websites.
</p>
<p>
  Why would you want this? If you aren't into Web development, most probably you
  wouldn't. However, if you are into Web development, the extension helps you
  identify (unexpected) Service Worker registrations in the wild and lets you
  analyze their code and learn from them.
</p>
<p>
  Why would you use this extension and not just the amazing Chrome Developer
  Tools? The answer is that the extension proactively detects Service Workers
  before you even have to open the Developer Tools (which you probably
  eventually will end up doing anyway).

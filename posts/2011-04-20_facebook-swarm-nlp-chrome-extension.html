<b>Facebook Swarm NLP Chrome Extension</b><br />
<br />
Dear Facebook users,<br />
<br />
Do you want to take part in a fun (well, at least kind of, the geek in you will like it) experiment? If so, please install the <a href="http://bit.ly/facebookswarmnlp">Facebook Swarm NLP Chrome extension</a>, and just browse <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>. That's it.<br />
<br />
You will see that the main topics (more or less adequate) of your friends' status updates will be annotated. The overall goal of this experiment is to get a bigger picture of what people talk about on Facebook.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as we are at it, you might also like the <a href="http://bit.ly/twitterswarmnlp">same thing for Twitter</a>. I'm also interested to find out the main differences of people's Facebook conversations vs. their <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> conversations.<br />
<br />
If you want to support me, please share the links <a href="http://bit.ly/facebookswarmnlp">http://bit.ly/facebookswarmnlp</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/twitterswarmnlp">http://bit.ly/twitterswarmnlp</a> with your friends or contacts. <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

PS: do you, too, hate Twitter's "Who to Follow" where it should be "<a href="http://blog.tomayac.com/index.php?date=2011-02-24&time=11:57:23&perma=Twitter+Whom+To+Foll.html">Who<u>m</u> to Follow</a>"? Now here is a way to fix it...

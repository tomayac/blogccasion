<b>Parts of Barcelona still without power</b><br />
<br />
Another groundhog day. It is 1:49pm, I have been for more than 48 hours without power, my fridge is an advance warning of what global warming will cause if we do not stop it, and the local public library is playing the "we are closing for dinner" jingle. Feels like one of those parties where the DJ at the end gets out the music your parent's parents used to listen to... They are switching the lights off now. Guess it is time to leave. I have charged my laptop batteries, the power should last for the lunch break. It is not awesome depending on opening hours of libraries for getting work done.

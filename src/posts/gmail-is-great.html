<b>Archiving my email with Gmail and labels</b><br />
<br />
Today I archived my old email. My <b>first (still stored) email dates back to 1998</b>. I have stored my correspondence in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">mbox format</a>, first using Netscape, then Mozilla and today Thunderbird. With Gmail's great search technique and the more than 2 gigabyte of memory I thought it was just great to really have all mails accessible online.<br />
<br />
Question is: <b>how to get the email in Gmail</b>? Therefore I discovered Mark Lyon's simple, multi-platform <a href="http://www.marklyon.org/gmail/download.htm">Gmail Loader</a> whose only purpose is to <ol><li>read an mbox file</li><li>forward all the emails contained to a Gmail account</li></ol> Forwarding the email comes along with the <b>inconvenience of all the original sent dates being lost</b> (the dates are kept inside the mail text). Being given the opportunities I have, this is a compromise I can live with.<br />
<br />
A feature I considered kind of useless are <a href="http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2005/01/25/Gmail.html">Gmail labels</a>. Till this day. With labels you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tags">tag semantic information</a> to each mail. Now I just love labels like 'Friends', 'Work', 'Family', ... They help me organize my mail and simply make my life easier.<br />

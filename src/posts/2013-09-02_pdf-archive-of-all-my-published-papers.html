<b>PDF Archive of All My Published Papers</b><br />
<br />
I have created a folder on my Web space of <a href="http://tomayac.com/papers/">all my published papers</a> from my <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K3TsGbgAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1">Google Scholar profile</a>. Hopefully Google Scholar will <a href="http://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing">index</a> them correctly and match them with my profile. Providing this list is part of the preparational steps for <a href="https://postgrau.upc.edu/computing/phd-thesis-all-doctoral-students/copy_of_thesis-document-and-defence">thesis submission</a> at my university.<br />

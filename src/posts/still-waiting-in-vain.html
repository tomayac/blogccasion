<b>Still waiting in vain</b><br />
<br />
When we arrived at the hospital in the early morning hours we felt like relieved: after the endless nine months of waiting, finally the baby would arrive real soon now! Everyone had told us that for the second baby with the beginning of the first contractions the baby was due within only a few hours. While the gynecologist said the baby would probably even be born one or two weeks before the due date March 1, already on the taxi ride to the hospital everything seemed less stressfull than envisioned. It is March 2 now, one day after the expected day, and still no baby. Laura was told to walk around a lot which we did, and she is away for another examination now. Maybe they just send us home again, as she feels better than ever, without even the smallest contraction now. Man, waiting is terrible. I imagine <i>her</i> face now, little Emma (still with a '?', but with a smaller one), smiling and feeling perfect in her belly. Why leave when inside its warm and comfy? Because there is so much love, and joy, and a <b>wonderful world</b> behind the belly button! Waiting with my heart wide open for you, little Emma!

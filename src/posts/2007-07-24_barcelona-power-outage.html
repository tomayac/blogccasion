<b>Barcelona power outage</b><br />
<br />
For more than 24 hours Barcelona is currently experiencing a <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=power+outage+barcelona">power outage</a>. The supermarkets now work like they did 100 years ago: you tell the shop owner at the door what you want, he gets it, and finally you pay.<br />
During the opening hours I head to the <a href="http://w3.bcn.es/ab/asia/equipament/controller/0,2317,1989545_1995403_2,00.html?accio=fitxa_eq&idEquip=2123115923">public library</a>, and at present am working on one laptop while I am charging the other for the time where the library is closed... It is a great place though, free WiFi, free electricity, free chairs, and a roof over my head.

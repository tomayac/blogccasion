<b>Batch-convert PDFs to JPEGs and extract raw text from PDFs</b><br />
<br />
One of the requirements my university imposes in order to formally submit a PhD thesis is to provide an overview of all published papers and their abstracts. I had PDF versions of all papers and wanted to automate the process. Here is a documentation of the steps, in the hope that this may be useful for others.<br />
<br />
<b>Requirements:</b> This write-up assumes you are working on Mac, but it should work on all platforms.<ul><li>install <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>, I use <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>: <span style="font-family:monospace;">port install ImageMagick</span>.</li><li>Install <a href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html">Xpdf</a>, using MacPorts this boils down to: <span style="font-family:monospace;">port install Xpdf</span>.</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>PDF to JPG / JPEG Process:</b> First, put all PDFs in one separate folder, this will make your life easier. Second, convert all PDFs to JPEGs using this command:<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family:monospace;">for i in `ls *.pdf`; do convert -density 300 "$i" "$i".jpg; done</span><br />
<br />
You may want to rescale the images (this could probably be done more elegantly in one step, I just did it in two).<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family:monospace;">for i in `ls *.jpg`; do convert "$i" -geometry x128 "$i"; done</span><br />
<br />
<b>PDF to Raw Text Process:</b> For my paper index page, I just needed the first page (ACM style), so I used the following command:<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family:monospace;">for i in `ls *.pdf`; xpdf-pdftotext -f 1 -l 1 "$i" "$i".txt; done</span><br />
<br />
This gives you a more or less correct raw text version of the PDF. Your mileage may vary, problem cases are especially footnotes, small caps, and strange formatting. I had to manually go through the text files and deleted everything besides the paper title and abstract.<br />
<br />
<b>Paper Index Page Process:</b> I wrote a small script that loops over all PDFs, fetches the corresponding abstract, title, and image preview and returns the HTML. The resulting <a href="http://tomayac.com/papers/">paper index page</a> is online now (if you spot any conversion errors, please let me know, there are quite a few I am sure).<br />

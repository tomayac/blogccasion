<p>The other day, I read an article by <a href="https://github.com/dgieselaar">Dario Gieselaar</a> on <a href="https://medium.com/zoover-engineering/optimizing-css-by-removing-unused-media-queries-80b5508c6de9">Optimizing CSS by removing unused media queries</a>.
One of the core ideas is that you can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#attr-media"><code>media</code> attribute</a> when including your stylesheets like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link href="print.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print"&gt;
&lt;link href="mobile.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 600px)"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In the article, Dario links to <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl">Scott Jehl</a>'s <a href="http://scottjehl.github.io/CSS-Download-Tests/">CSS Downloads by Media Query</a> test suite where Scott shows how <em>browsers would still download stylesheets even if their media queries are non-matching</em>.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/CSS-Download-Tests/issues/11#issue-378471829">pointed out</a> that the priority of these downloads is <code>Lowest</code>, so they're at least not competing with core resources on the page:</p>
<p><amp-img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/145676/48161126-2073ad80-e2da-11e8-9699-92f7e95cb5b8.png" width="412" height="252" alt="Waterfall diagram showing how stylesheets with non-matching media queries are downloaded at lowest priority"></amp-img></p>
<p>At first sight this still seemed suboptimal, and I thought that even if the priority is <code>Lowest</code>, maybe the browser shouldn't trigger downloads at all. So I did some research, and, surprise, it turns out that the CSS spec writers and browser implementors are actually pretty darn smart about this:</p>
<p>The thing is, the user <em>could</em> always decide to resize their window (impacting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/width">width</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/height">height</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/aspect-ratio">aspect ratio</a>), to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#Media_types">print</a> the document, <em>etc.</em>, and even things that at first sight <em>seem</em> static (like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/resolution">resolution</a>) can change when a user with a multi-screen setup moves a window from say a <em>Retina</em> laptop screen to a bigger desktop monitor, or the user can unplug their <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/any-pointer">mouse</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>Truly static things that can't change (a TV device can't suddenly turn into something else) are actually being <em>deprecated</em> in <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries">Media Queries Level 4</a> (see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#Media_types">yellow note box</a>); and the recommendation is to rather target <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries/#media-feature">media features</a> instead (see the text under the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries/#media-types">red issue box</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, even invalid values like <code>media="nonsense"</code> still need to be considered, according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/conform.html#ignore">ignore rules</a> in the spec.</p>
<p>So long story short, browsers try to be as smart as possible by applying priorities, and <code>Lowest</code> is a reasonable value for the cases in Scott's <a href="http://scottjehl.github.io/CSS-Download-Tests/">test</a>.</p>

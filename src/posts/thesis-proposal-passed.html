<b>Thesis Proposal Passed</b><br />
<br />
After a tough rehearsal session with my tutor at <a href="http://www.upc.edu/">UPC.edu</a> yesterday evening, today I have successfully passed the thesis proposal defense in front of a university committee. The viva voce slides can be seen below. Thanks to my tutors <a href="http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~gabarro/">Kim Gabarr? Vall?s</a> from UPC and <a href="https://plus.google.com/102497386507936526460/posts">Michael Hausenblas</a> from <a href="http://www.deri.ie/">DERI</a> for their very valuable input. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/arnaudbrousseau">Arnaud Brousseau</a> for taking over most of the <a href="http://www.isearch-project.eu/isearch/">I-SEARCH</a> work in the last few weeks, so that I could focus on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23tomsphd">#TomsPhD</a>. Yay, good day!<br />

<p>We have a 24 inch <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP16?locale=en_US">Mid 2007 iMac</a> in our living room that is clearly showing its age, but still working OK enough (albeit slow) as a TV (SD channels on DVB-C via USB stick), DVD player, and Web streaming station. The machine is stuck on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_El_Capitan">macOS El Capitan</a> (OS X version 10.11.6) and doesn't get updates anymore. I was wondering if putting Linux on it might help.</p>

<p>I ended up installing <a href="https://xubuntu.org/release/18-04/">Xubuntu 18.04 (64 bit)</a>, mainly because it uses the lightweight <a href="https://xfce.org/">Xfce window manager</a>. For some reason USB boot never worked (the same USB pen booted on a MacBook Air just fine), so I went and, in 2018, bought some DVD+RWs (probably the last time I ever do this) and it booted.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<p>All hardware was immediately recognized and ready to go, including the (proprietary) Wi-Fi drivers, the multimedia keys on the iMac keyboard, the mouse wheel (I had to compile a kernel back in <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianHamm">Debian 2.0. Hamm</a> times), and even the USB TV stick (<a href="http://www.hauppauge.de/site/products/data_hvr930chd.html">Hauppauge 930C</a>, I needed to <a href="https://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge_WinTV-HVR-930C#Step_by_step_instructions">copy its firmware</a> file to <code>/lib/firmwares</code>). The system overall boots a lot faster (it's still a spinning HDD and still only has 2GB of RAM) and, once up, feels really snappy again (Firefox Quantum is a lot faster than Chrome Beta to start, though). Dual boot works fine, everyone recommends <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/">rEFInd</a>, so I just went with that.</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p>The system still doesn't decode HD DVB-C channels smoothly (<ins>it does now, see the update below</ins>), despite being on only ~25% CPU load (compared to 99% on macOS where it works neither). If there's someone from <a href="https://linuxtv.org/">Linux TV</a> reading along, I'd love to talk to you. I don't particularly like <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Software">Gnome Software</a> that Xubuntu ships with instead of <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter">Ubunutu Software Center</a>, but I fixed this by installing the <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/">Synaptic Package Manager</a>.</p>

<p>2018. The year of the Linux desktop <code>:-)</code></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I learned about the <a href="http://www.tvdr.de">VDR project</a> yesterday, and after some fiddling now have <strong>HD</strong> DVB-C TV on Xubuntu, something that never even worked on macOS. The setup was super involved and old-school Linux, but thanks a ton to the Debian folks for the helpful <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/VDR#Installing_VDR">instructions to install VDR</a>.</p>
